 Commentary: Driving an EV does not make you pro-environment  ,"['When I started driving an electric vehicle in 2018, I became part of the problem.', 'Not for the reasons cited by EV critics during the recent heat wave, when the state asked that electric cars not be charged during peak demand. That prompted howls of “I told you so” from those who think the electrification of everything from home appliances to cars is a left-wing pipe dream, especially in light of California’s mandate requiring 100% of all new vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2035.', 'Nor am I part of the problem because of the worries expressed ad nauseum by EV skeptics, few of which have much merit.', 'Yes, driving distance is an issue, but only for a tiny percentage of trips.', 'Yes, my electricity bill is higher, but the additional cost is far lower than what drivers pay for gas.', 'Yes, apartment and condo dwellers who cannot plug in at night have legitimate concerns, because they must rely on our public charging infrastructure — which is growing.', 'Yes, EVs have a carbon footprint, but still typically much smaller than those of gas cars. On this, the evidence is so compelling that it’s hard to imagine survival on this planet unless we immediately replace gas-powered autos with electric ones. Consequently, if the state and federal governments want to take meaningful action on climate change, they have no choice but to subsidize EV buyers.', 'And that’s part of the problem. In the end, an electric car is still, well, a car — and mass car ownership has devastating environmental consequences beyond tailpipe emissions.', 'I became part of this car culture in 2018, after The Times moved from downtown L.A. to El Segundo. Until then I was a dedicated transit commuter and even held out for months after The Times’ relocation. But five hours a day on buses and trains eventually got to me, so I leased a Nissan Leaf.', 'Then a funny thing happened: Some well-meaning people reacted as if I had done the world a favor. Never mind the loss of a transit user to 60-mile daily drives — I had become an EV operator, once pitied for bus riding, now praised for driving.', 'But electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, require vast expanses of concrete and asphalt for automotive use. This paving over of entire regions has turned neighborhoods into heat sinks that soak up energy from the sun during the day and release it at night — not exactly what we want in an era of accelerating climate change.', 'And electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, force their drivers to sit in the same traffic jams as everyone else, often on freeways that required the bulldozing of long-established, minority communities to be built. In Downey, locals are fighting a highway expansion plan that would displace residents from more than 200 homes. I haven’t asked, but something tells me “yeah, but more electric cars” wouldn’t convince those residents to give up fighting for their homes.', 'And electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, needlessly kill people. In the city of Los Angeles, a record 294 people were killed in traffic in 2021. Inadequate infrastructure is largely to blame, but so is the increasing size of cars — and electric cars are getting bigger too, to make them more appealing to American consumers.', 'This isn’t to say there aren’t benefits to replacing dirty vehicles with zero-emission ones. Cities need to curb air pollution, and electric cars cause very little of it. Children living near freeways have higher rates of asthma, and trading internal combustion engines for electric motors would certainly help them.', 'But replacing one kind of car for another isn’t enough if cities like Los Angeles want to be anything other than traffic-choked dystopias. Right now, subsidizing EV ownership to the tune of nearly $10,000 off a car’s sticker price (in California) may be necessary to reduce the acceleration of climate change, but it’s also just a Band-Aid to buy time for systemic change to take hold.', 'And what kind of systemic change would that be? Build out a big public transit system (L.A. is trying), and make it free, reliable and safe. Subsidize the purchase of electric bikes, which make it easier to commute longer distances on devices that use considerably less power and road space than electric cars. Think more of what people in neighborhoods need than what people driving through those neighborhoods want.', 'And for the love of God, shelter every bus stop on every block, so riders don’t risk sunstroke when they take transit during a heat wave.']","Sept. 17, 2022 3:10 AM PT ",latimes,west-coast
 Op-Ed: Think bigger. Switching to electric cars isn’t enough ,"['It might feel like the easy solution — just replace your gas-guzzling SUV with an electric SUV, and if everyone does that, eventually we’ll solve climate change. You can see why California regulators decided last month that by 2035, all new cars sold in the state must be electric. After all, car exhaust is the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California, so surely switching gas-powered cars to electric ones will make a huge dent in fighting climate change.', 'Except it doesn’t. For starters, electric cars still pollute. They don’t have tailpipe emissions, but the process of producing and transporting them creates pollution. According to the International Energy Agency, the average gas-powered car will create 41.9 tons of CO2 emissions from the point it’s manufactured until it’s retired, in contrast to 21.1 tons of CO2 from an EV. In other words, while the average EV will pollute about 50% less compared  with a gas-powered car, it’s still highly polluting.', 'There’s also pollution, and other harms, that come before the manufacturing stage, especially in the intensifying global competition to procure rare earth materials (concentrated in China) for EV batteries. In the past, we have often been dependent on the Middle East for oil. Do we want to create a future in which we’re again dependent on countries that may not be aligned with our values for required materials for our transportation system?', 'The second issue is power capacity. During the first week in September, California faced a historic heat wave, and alerts were issued asking EV owners to not charge their vehicles during peak times. And this is at a time when only 1.9% of cars operating in California are EVs. What happens when that number is 5%? Or 20%? Without a dramatic increase in power production from clean sources, it won’t be possible to supply power to all the EVs without ramping up use of coal and natural gas for electricity generation, increasing emissions from fossil fuels.', 'There are some bottom lines that are true whether cars are powered by fossil fuels or electricity:', 'Electric cars are just as dangerous for people outside the car; if you get hit by a 9,000-pound electric Hummer or a 7,000-pound gas Hummer, you’re dead either way. EVs are just as dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists as their gas-powered cousins, and rushing to adopt them without changing the way we use space on our streets is a recipe for a continued upward trend of pedestrian, cyclist and driver deaths.', 'Electric cars take up the same amount of space as gas-powered cars; even if we could wave a wand and convert every car on the road today to an EV, traffic would still be miserable, and the demand for driving and parking space would continue to suck the lifeblood out of our cities.', 'Additionally, car-based infrastructure is very expensive. In 1982, President Reagan signed a law that allocated 80% of the Highway Trust Fund to highways, and 20% to public transportation. This means the country built and maintains an extraordinarily expensive roadway network at the expense of quality high-speed trains and investments in other non-car infrastructure. In 2019, we spent $203 billion nationwide on highways and roads, and that amount is low compared to what is needed. (The highway trust fund doesn’t actually cover all the maintenance costs of highways, and we haven’t raised the federal gas tax since 1993.) ', 'If all cars were electric, we would still spend a disproportionate amount of money building and maintaining car infrastructure, with little left over to build world-class high-speed rail, bus or bike infrastructure inside and between our cities. We would still have outdated parking requirements for developers — which drive up the cost of housing and aggravate sprawl. And because EVs typically weigh more than their gas-powered counterparts, and heavier vehicles wear down the road faster, we will need to spend even more money on maintenance over the long term.', 'Electric cars aren’t a panacea to solve climate change. They can be part of the solution, but a myopic focus on electric cars as the solution prevents us from seeing so many other ideas. We need a future with fewer cars (electric or not) and much more public transit and bike usage. We need a complete rethink of how we use our public space, and better infrastructure so people can take short trips without using a car.', 'There are no shortcuts to solving climate change. We shouldn’t assume that once every gas-powered car is replaced with an electric one, we’ll solve the problem — because we won’t. We should instead put our energy into redoing how we use our road space, to truly curb pollution and needless death and bring life back into our cities.', 'Michael Schneider is the founder of Streets for All.']","Sept. 15, 2022 3 AM PT ",latimes,west-coast
" Editorial: EPA wants to speed up EV switch. Good, the planet needs it ","['The Biden administration just proposed hitting the accelerator on the transition to electric vehicles. If these ambitious new rules are enacted, the U.S. could make major progress in fighting climate change.', 'The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday released new pollution standards for passenger cars and trucks that would be the strongest vehicle emission regulations to date. To comply, automakers would have to significantly increase the number of electric vehicles they produce over the next decade.', 'That would be a huge change in the vehicle market, which has slowly been rolling out zero-emission models.

', 'Swapping out that many combustion engines would slash planet-warming pollution from the transportation sector, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. The EPA projects the regulations would avoid putting into the atmosphere nearly 10 billion tons of carbon emissions, which is the equivalent of two times the total U.S. carbon emissions in 2022.', 'These vehicle pollution standards could be one of the  United States’ most important steps in staving off the most devastating effects of global warming and reducing exposure to unhealthful pollution — if the regulations are put into place.

There are also real worries about whether the U.S. will have the charging stations and electric grid capability to power all those new EVs. Cost and the lack of charging stations are key reasons why 60% of consumers said they are not likely to buy an electric car as their next vehicle, according to a recent survey.', 'Those are challenges that must be addressed more urgently. But that doesn’t mean the EPA should wait for all problems to be solved before pressing ahead with aggressive vehicle emissions standards. Regulations drive results, and the planet needs results quickly.', 'A United Nations report released last month warned the planet is on track to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, a critical threshold virtually every nation on Earth has agreed to work to avoid to prevent greater harm from climate change. To avoid that fate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world needs to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035.', 'Reaching that requires transforming the transportation sector.

We’ll soon find out ,"['When the eyes of the world turn to Los Angeles for the 2028 Olympic Games, will they see a smog-choked city full of traffic jams, gas furnaces and fossil-fueled power plants? Or a beacon of light in a polluted world, bursting with solar panels, electric cars and induction stoves?', 'The short answer: probably both. ', 'But an ambitious plan unveiled Wednesday could lead to more of the good stuff and less of the bad stuff.', ""You're reading Boiling Point"", 'Sammy Roth gets you up to speed on climate change, energy and the environment. Sign up to get it in your inbox twice a week.', ' You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', 'The clean energy road map — crafted by the nonprofit Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and endorsed by city and county officials, state agencies and utility company Southern California Edison, among others — lays out aggressive new climate goals for Los Angeles County. Those goals include a 15% reduction in planet-warming pollution between now and 2028, made possible by big investments in local solar power, clean transportation, electric heating, energy efficiency and more.', 'For Matt Petersen, the incubator’s president, the Olympics and Paralympics are a perfect time to demonstrate to the world that it’s not just Sacramento leading the way on climate change, as Gov. Gavin Newsom is currently showcasing in China. Los Angeles on its own is the world’s third-largest municipal economy, and it can play a crucial role in inspiring badly needed global action.', '“We don’t get everything right,” Petersen acknowledged. “But we can move the needle.”', 'So where is Los Angeles doing well, and where can we do better?', 'On the bright side: The city of L.A.’s target of 100% clean electricity by 2035 is a decade ahead of the state’s mandate, and in line with what scientists say is necessary to keep the heat waves, droughts and storms of the climate crisis — which are already pretty terrible — from spiraling too far out of control. The Clean Power Alliance — a government agency that buys electricity on behalf of much of the rest of L.A. County — has also invested heavily in renewable power, including a massive desert solar farm that should come online later this month and is equipped with batteries to store sunshine for after dark.', 'But those efforts are far from enough.', 'Los Angeles is infamous for its clogged freeways, sprawling housing developments and relative lack of public transit. Even with local officials making a tremendous push ahead of the 2028 Olympics to expand the light-rail system and add bus lanes and bike paths, the region must do far more to reshape its car-centric urban infrastructure. Cars, trucks and other vehicles fill our air with harmful chemicals and unhealthy particles, and produce roughly 40% of L.A. County’s heat-trapping carbon emissions.', 'Buildings are responsible for another 40%, our space heaters, water heaters and stoves making a significant contribution to global warming. The Los Angeles City Council voted last year to ban most gas appliances in new homes and businesses, which is a good first step. But it leaves millions of existing buildings where gas will need to be swapped out for electric alternatives.', 'The new clean energy road map is focused on cleaning up those polluters: buildings and vehicles.', 'On the buildings front, the road map envisions 3 million electric heat pumps for space and water heating being installed in L.A. County by 2028, along with 78,000 electric stoves and clothes dryers. Those appliances would help slash climate pollution from buildings 29% below what’s otherwise expected, while supporting or creating 111,000 jobs, the cleantech incubator estimates.', 'On the vehicles front, the road map adopts an existing set of goals endorsed by many of the same partners — including that 80% of passenger cars sold in L.A. County be electric by 2028, helping fuel a 25% reduction in carbon pollution from transport.', 'Sound impossible? So does the alternative. A team of international researchers reported this week that human beings are “on our way to the potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems and a world with unbearable heat and shortages of food and freshwater,” in the words of an Oregon State University scientist who was one of the study’s lead authors.', 'For cities and states looking to lead the world to a safer climate, that means there’s no such thing as moving too fast.', '“I do worry that to get to these 2030, 2035 goals, these 2028 goals — we are perhaps behind right now,” said Mary Leslie, president of the Los Angeles Business Council and board chair of the agency overseeing California’s main electric grid.', '“This is a pretty radical deal we’re talking about,” she said at a Wednesday event announcing the new road map.', 'Supplying power to tens of millions of cars, trucks and household appliances — plus all the stuff we already use electricity for — will require building loads of solar panels, wind turbines and other climate-friendly energy. The biggest chunk of that power will almost certainly come from faraway solar and wind farms, which can produce electricity at a lower cost than rooftop solar.', 'But there’s still huge potential for rooftop solar, which can help cities stay powered when wildfires or other disruptions batter the larger electric grid — an increasingly common problem as the climate crisis screws around with global weather systems.', 'The new road map estimates Los Angeles County will need nearly 12,000 gigawatt-hours of new energy supplies a year come 2028, to power the many additional electric cars and appliances envisioned by its authors. The document sets targets for getting all of that energy from solar panels on houses and apartment buildings, as well as “community solar” facilities that serve renters who can’t install or can’t afford their own panels.', 'That would be a big deal, if it happens.', 'The road map also calls for a “virtual power plant” that would bring together rooftop solar panels, electric-vehicle batteries and stand-alone batteries in household garages to relieve stress on the power grid — especially during summer heat waves that are getting worse with climate change and making it harder to keep the lights on as families crank up the air conditioning.', 'That would be a big deal, too.', 'Already, the city of Los Angeles has 665 megawatts of local solar power, according to Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor for energy and sustainability. That’s more than any other U.S. city, and puts L.A. in a strong position to keep leading the way.', '“The future is alive and well here in Los Angeles,” Sutley said at Wednesday’s event.', 'I was especially intrigued by Southern California Edison’s involvement with the road map, since it’s one of many investor-owned utility companies that have pushed officials in California and elsewhere to limit rooftop solar incentives.', 'Edison has a lot to gain from electric cars, heaters and stovetops, which create additional need for long-distance power lines and other lucrative infrastructure. Rooftop solar limits the need for that infrastructure, cutting against Edison’s business model.', 'But Stephen Lassiter — a policy director at Sunrun, America’s largest rooftop solar installer — told me he had a good experience working with Edison in the discussions that led to the clean energy road map. He noted that the two companies have previously partnered on a small virtual power plant, and that Sunrun is increasingly teaming up with car companies and major energy users such as Google on creative strategies to ensure there’s enough juice on the electric grid every hour of every day. ', 'The new road map sets targets for those kinds of strategies, including “demand response” programs that pay people to use less electricity when the grid is stressed, and electric-vehicle batteries capable of sending power back to the grid in a pinch.', 'Lassiter quoted Sunrun’s chief executive as arguing that “radical collaboration” is needed for climate progress.', '“We want to build that future in partnership with all the folks in the room,” Lassiter said. “That’s what it’s going to take.”', 'He’s right. But our conversation still left me wondering: Are utility companies such as SoCal Edison up for the task?', 'Before Wednesday’s event, I spent a few minutes talking with Erik Takayesu, Edison’s senior vice president of asset strategy and planning, at the cleantech incubator’s downtown headquarters. Although he didn’t want to weigh in on a recent decision by state officials to slash rooftop solar incentive payments — which Edison had urged, arguing the payments have driven up electric rates — Takayesu said the company supports the new road map, including its emphasis on rooftop solar and household batteries.', 'Those resources, he said, will help Los Angeles keep up with rapid growth in electric cars, heat pumps and induction stoves.', '“You’re going to need more local resources — there’s no doubt about that,” he said. “The work starts now.”', 'That was a theme among everyone I talked with for this column: The work starts now. ', 'It’s true for so many people in positions of power — starting with members of the “clean energy partnership” that produced the road map, who continue to hash out policies to support their goals. It’s true for the L.A. city staff studying whether to require air conditioning in every rental unit — a rule that would help vulnerable families stay cool as the planet warms but would also mean we need to build even more clean energy. It’s true for the L.A. Department of Water and Power officials working to ensure that low-income communities of color long burdened by fossil fuel pollution reap the benefits of clean energy.', 'And it’s true for political leaders who must find a way to limit the region’s continued reliance on natural gas.', 'That includes Newsom’s appointees on the California Public Utilities Commission, who voted this year to let Southern California Gas Co. store far more fuel at the Aliso Canyon gas storage field, eight years after a record-shattering methane leak. ', 'It also includes L.A. Mayor Karen Bass’ appointees to the board of the Department of Water and Power, who are tasked with overseeing the city’s plans for 100% clean energy. Right now, those plans include switching several gas-fired power plants to unproven hydrogen technology, rather than closing them — which may end up working out great but is seen by environmental justice activists as unacceptably risky, especially for the low-income, largely Latino community surrounding one of the plants.', 'Then there’s L.A.’s greatest climate villain of all: our sprawling, car-centric cityscape.', 'It’s hard for me to imagine Los Angeles as a beacon of light on climate change and clean air as long as our region is defined by gasoline. What kind of message will it send to the world when Olympic athletes and spectators inevitably get stuck in an hour of traffic on the 10? Or if television broadcasts air “scenic” images of jam-packed freeways ?', '“The future of cars is electric. But the future can’t be just about the cars,” said Rick Cole, L.A.’s chief deputy controller.', 'Earlier this month, Cole’s office released a report criticizing the city’s Green New Deal climate strategy — launched by former Mayor Eric Garcetti and embraced by his successor, Bass — as outdated and insufficient. But when we talked Wednesday, Cole gave the newly released clean energy road map a largely positive review, especially its focus on local solar power.', 'He also emphasized the pressing need to rebuild Los Angeles around people, not cars — which means refashioning our streets to support walking, biking and buses, and also building more housing in dense neighborhoods near public transit stations. The city’s Green New Deal calls for reducing the number of miles we travel in cars nearly 40% per person by 2035.', 'Cole expressed frustration with a statement from Bass last week rejecting calls to study the demolition of the 90 Freeway — just two months after the mayor expressed support for the proposal. After initially calling the 90 a “freeway to nowhere” (it runs just three miles) and praising a plan to replace it with thousands of homes and a large public park, Bass took a U-turn, saying she had “heard loud and clear from communities who would be impacted and I do not support a study on this initiative.”', 'At the same time, Cole pointed to the City Council’s recent approval of community plan updates in Hollywood and downtown — which should allow for construction of up to 135,000 new homes in the coming years — as an example of climate progress. ', '“We’re moving in the right direction, but glacially,” he said.', 'It’s important not to lose track of the climate progress we’ve already made. When I chatted with L.A. City Council President Paul Krekorian before Wednesday’s event, he recalled serving in the state Legislature in the late 2000s, and all the arguments he heard back then against a proposal to mandate 33% renewable energy by 2020 — arguments that seem quaint in retrospect.', '“All the things we’re doing now that a few years ago people said were impossible — it gives you a lot more hope for the future about the things that people are saying are impossible now,” Krekorian told me.', 'For better or worse, the eyes of the world will turn to Los Angeles in 2028. We won’t solve all of our problems between now and then, but we’ve got a chance to prove that a better future is possible. Let’s give it everything we’ve got.', 'I began Tuesday’s edition  of this column by writing that Norman Rogers “has worked at the West Coast’s largest oil refinery for nearly a quarter-century — and he’s ready to be part of the fossil fuel industry’s undoing.”', 'After the piece published, I got an email from Rogers — a vice president at United Steelworkers Local 675 — taking issue with my language, and clarifying it’s not his desire to dismantle companies that have long provided high-quality jobs for himself and his colleagues. Undoing the fossil fuel industry, he wrote, is not why he’s part of a newly launched coalition of labor unions that will lobby California to help oil and gas workers transition to clean energy jobs.', 'Rather, Rogers wants to ensure “a place for our people to land” as the economy shifts to clean energy, and fossil fuel jobs begin to go away — a transition beyond his control. ', '“What myself and the coalition are working towards are paths to protect our members,” he wrote.', 'Navigating the nuances of the energy transition isn’t easy. I’ll keep doing my best to get it right.', 'We’ll be back in your inbox Tuesday. To view this newsletter in your web browser, click here.

Adapt or mitigate? Washington Republicans roll out climate proposal,"A new proposal from Washington State Republicans highlights the conversation around how to both reduce and mitigate emissions while adapting to a warming world, and may provide a blueprint for what conservative climate policies could entail in the future.Yesterday,Rep. Mary Dye (R-Pomeroy)introduced a package of environmental proposals called theOutdoor Recreation and Climate Adaptation plan, ORCA for short. It outlines  Republican preferences for how to spendClimate Commitment Actdollars — specifically investing it into forest health, eliminating the $30 Discover Pass needed to access state parks, upgrading wastewater treatment plants, and addressing drought and flooding.The Morning Wire: Keeping you informed on politics, policies, and personalities of Washington State.For Dye, the proposal provides immediate benefits for the state.“Washingtonians deserve to have more practical environmentalism so that they get tangible benefits,” Dye said. “We’ve had a lot of environmental problems that have been languishing because there hasn’t been political will or financial commitment to it.”The plan highlights a divide in addressing climate change and a question that will continue to drive policy conversations: Should states prioritize cutting emissions first, or planning for infrastructure needed to adapt to a warming world? And where is the balancing point between them?Climate Commitment ActDuring the 2021 session, Washington’s legislature passed the Climate Commitment Act. A keystone of this legislation was acap-and-invest program, whereby large polluters — beginning in 2023 — will be charged for generating emissions above a prescribed limit. The program could generate $4 billion over the following 10 years, with more than 70% of revenue in most years being directed to the Carbon Emissions Reduction Account, according to an analysis in Dye’s proposal.According to the most recent greenhouse gas emissionsinventory report, released last January and including years up to 2018, Washington’s emissions have increased steadily since 2012 as the state recovered from the Recession. Emissions rose 1.3% from 2017 to 2018, reaching a total of 99.6 million metric tons, the highest seen since 2007.Of this, transportation was the largest category of emissions, accounting for 44.9%. Building heating came in second, accounting for 23.8%, followed by electrical generation, producing 16.3%.To meet Washington’sclimate goals, the state needs to cut emissions by half, or eliminate roughly 50 million metric tons of emissions by 2030. The following graphic, provided at a recent Senate Environment, Energy and Technology Committee meeting, breaks down how different policies are expected to impact that work.Greenhouse gas emissions are drivingclimate change, as concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gasses like methane trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere.Globally, fossil fuels used for electricity and heat, agriculture, industry and transportation make up the majority of emissions.Sen. Reuven Carlyle (D-Seattle)said emission reductions are a crucial part of decarbonizing the state, along with other strategies.“That’s sustainable aviation fuel, other biofuels, renewable hydrogen, it’s electrification of transportation, it is modernizing our grid and energy storage, issues that aren’t exclusive to transportation or non-transportation,” Carlyle said. “… The number one goal, upside down and backwards, is to reach science-based 2050 targets. That’s our goal, and I’m all ears in terms of recommendations, ideas, suggestions for how to get there.”The Climate Commitment Act is also designed to align with the Healthy Environment for All Act, which also passed last session, and emphasizes environmental justice and protecting vulnerable communities.It requires the Washington Environmental Justice Council to make recommendations to the legislature on which projects to fund, expands air quality monitoring in impacted communities. The Department of Ecology must set air quality targets to improve quality and eliminate disparities for overburdened communities and adopt new standards to meet those targets. Taken together, it lays the groundwork for both addressing local air pollution and global emissions, according to theEnvironmental Defense Fund.It carves out money for projects undertaken by Tribes and for overburdened communities. In total, at least 35% of funding must go to provide direct benefits to communities that are disproportionately impacted by environmental harms, and 10% will go to Tribes.However, the lion’s share of funding is focused on reducing emissions, including by building out electric vehicle infrastructure, and for reducing emissions in freight transportation and in ports. It’s mitigation work that provides a global, and local, benefit in the long-term.Rulemaking for cap-and-invest is ongoing, and should be adopted by next fall, but no specific projects are identified in the legislation. Dye said her proposal would clearly identify where money raised from the program will go, and what projects will be impacted. She views Washington’s current emissions reduction programs as sufficient, namely the reducing amount that polluters will be able to emit over time.“It’s just buckets that have been identified as named funding pools,” Dye said of the current funding structure. “But they don’t have actual people that have submitted projects or identified that they really need that money, or that amount of money, or how it’s appropriated.”Taken from the ORCA plan.What’s in the ORCA planWhereas the current Climate Commitment Act is focused on reducing emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change, the ORCA Plan focuses its attention to adapting to those impacts. The proposal directs the $4 billion in revenue to outdoor recreation and climate adaptation.The plan states that Washington parks have $424 million in deferred maintenance, and while the state’s population has grown by 2.7 million since 1990, only 28 camping sites have been added during that time. The top 10 parks in the state are full, and must be booked a year in advance. Camping reservation costs have also increased.On outdoor recreation, it proposes eliminating the $30 annual Discover Pass which is needed to access state parks, pays for maintenance and upgrades at those parks, and increases capacity at parks.The plan also addresses adapting toclimate change impacts. With a global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, the limit which theParis Agreementstrived to keep warming below and which is becoming anincreasinglyunachievable goal, Washington will have 67% more days where temperatures soar above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.It will also see a 38% reduction in snowpack, a 16% increase in winter streamflow leading to flooding, and a 23% lower summer streamflow causing drought and problems forsalmonandagriculture. On aglobal scale, this will contribute to more frequent and intense natural disasters and storms, species extinctions, and human death and displacement.To address this through adaptation, Dye’s plan proposes fully funding efforts to restore 2.7 million acres of diseased and dying forests in Washington. The legislature authorized$125 millionin each biennial budget for this work, but has yet to set up a long-term funding source. The ORCA plan would use Climate Commitment Act money to fully fund this.On drought, the plan would direct funds to an existing drought preparation and response account, which also has no dedicated funding source. Funding could be used to match federal money for large water storage and irrigation projects.It further addresses flooding by setting aside revenue to reduce flood damage and improve fish habitat in basins at risk of flooding. In theflood-prone Chehalis basinalone, inaction on flood projects is expected to cost more than$3.5 billion. In addition, the plan sets aside money to pay for upgrades to Puget Sound wastewater treatment plants to reduce pollution which can lead to‘dead zones.’“Those are the things that I want to see us use the dollars for, instead of spending it on emissions reduction when it’s not gonna show a global benefit long-term, and we still will not have the infrastructure we need to adapt to the real and tangible impacts that we’re having today,” Dye said.The politics of climate policyAlready, the plan has attracted support from House Republican LeaderRep. JT Wilcox (R-Yelm), whopreviewed the legislationin a recent interview. Dye said there has also been support among Senate Republicans for the ORCA plan.“We can make a huge impact on carbon by fully and permanently funding the forest practices that are necessary for healthy forests, which sequester carbon at the fastest possible rate,” Wilcox said in previous coverage.Across the aisle, Carlyle also showed interest in the plan, calling it a serious piece of work. As the rulemaking process progresses, Carlyle said it’s constructive to have ideas on how to spend Climate Commitment Act money.“The money is not in the door yet, and the initial allocation between transportation and non-transportation topics, the broad categories of investment areas, all of those issues are legitimate and are on the table,” he said. “They should be rigorously studied and debated and examined from every angle, so I have no problem whatsoever with considering various ideas and proposals.”ForAseem Prakash, founding director of the University of Washington’s Center for Environmental Politics, the proposed plan and support among Republican lawmakers in Washington could serve as a blueprint for GOP politicians nationwide.While former President Donald Trumpcast doubton whether climate change was happening, Republican Congressmembershave launchedtheConservative Climate Caucuswhich has more than 70 members, including Washington’s Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler, Cathay McMorris Rodgers and Dan Newhouse.“I think Washington Republicans can become a role model for national Republicans,” Prakash said. “Climate denial is over.”For Prakash, it’s a smart political move to focus on adaptation. It provides tangible public goods in the short term, like more parks and improved water districts.“These are local benefits, so when the benefits are local and tangible, people are willing to pay taxes,” he said.It also highlights the urban-rural divide in Washington, he said, where for many people, climate impacts like sweeping wildfires east of the Cascades are annoyances instead of disasters. Other ideas like eliminating the Discover Pass could prove popular too.“I think there is a populist appeal here, and a very good one, it’s not reckless,” Prakash said. “… These people really have done their homework well, and what they’re saying should appeal more to the public than even electrification of EVs.”In climate politics, Prakash said there has been until recently a concern that discussing adaptation could diffuse mitigation efforts, both of which are generally agreed upon asbeing necessaryto address climate change.“Until recently, and by recently I mean 2019, the climate movement did not want to talk about adaptation, because the fear was the moment you talk about adaptation where the benefits are local… people won’t want to talk about mitigation,” he said.TheClimate Reality Projectwrote that the IPCC states both mitigation and adaptation are needed to address climate change. However, while adaptation provides immediate benefits, mitigation often provides global, far-away benefits. These defused benefits could lead residents of wealthier countries, that could bear the cost of reducing emissions, to choose only to adapt “while leaving everyone else behind.”It’s a problem Prakash is thinking about too, but pointed to a2018 studyon mitigation and adaptation support. The study was a web-based survey of 2,000 U.S. respondents. It asked participants whether they would support a proposed gasoline tax for both mitigation and adaptation costs.It found that providing information about adaption costs leads to a small increase in respondents’ willingness to support mitigation efforts. In short, Prakash said it supports the idea that touting both immediate adaptation benefits along with long-term emissions mitigation can lead to higher support for both.How that debate on the right mixture of mitigation and adaptation policy will play out in Washington State, and across the U.S., has yet to be seen.Your support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

Op-ed: Now is the Time to Electrify Public Vehicle Fleets,"Matthew Metz is the founder and co-executive director ofColtura, a Seattle-based non-profit that is working to transition the country to zero-emission vehicles. He wrote the following op-ed in reference to Coltura’srecent reporton Washington State’s public fleet electric vehicle compliance.State and local governments in Washington own more than 30,000 vehicles. Roughly 99 percent of these vehicles run on gasoline or diesel, consuming more than 30 million gallons annually and contributing to the growing climate crisis. While much has been written about the benefits of transitioning away from harmful greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels, many people do not realize that state law actually requires it.Effective June 1, 2018, state lawRCW 43.19.648, passed in 2007, requires that all state agencies and local government subdivisions must, “to the extent determined practicable… satisfy one hundred percent of their fuel usage for operating publicly owned vessels, vehicles, and construction equipment from electricity or biofuel.”So, how are we doing? Not well. New data published in “Recharge Required” shows most Washington public jurisdictions have not taken steps toward compliance or have only barely begun. The cities of Auburn, Federal Way, Kennewick, Kent, and Yakima have no electric vehicles (EVs) in their fleets. With the exception of Seattle, the 14 largest cities in the state only have between one and seven EVs in their respective fleets. Our counties are not doing any better. King County leads the way with nine EVs. Benton, Clark, Spokane, and Whatcom have no EVs in their fleets, and Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish, Thurston and Yakima counties reported five or fewer EVs in their fleets. Even Seattle and King County, relative leaders in electrification, still buy far more gas and diesel vehicles than electrics.The Morning Wire: Keeping you informed on politics, policies, and personalities of Washington State.What’s worse, there’s been no enforcement of the law. Public vehicle purchases are usually made quietly and under the political radar. The State Department of Commerce, charged with overseeing compliance by hundreds of state agencies and local governments with the law, has only two people working on the issue. Furthermore, regulations promulgated by the Department do not effectively implement the law nor do they provide meaningful guidance to public entities seeking to comply. Only four of the 31 local governmental entities surveyed have an actionable plan for electrifying their fleet. Annual, legally-mandated reporting by state agencies and local governments to Commerce on progress implementing the fleet electrification law has not occurred.Besides offering numerous health and climate benefits, compliance with state law would yield significant cost savings and economic benefits. Every gallon of gas burned emits 20 pounds of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. It is no wonder the transportation sector accounts for nearly half of all carbon dioxide pollution in the state, resulting in increased risks of asthma, heart and lung disease, dementia and cancers – especially in children and people living near busy roads.As for economic benefits, EVs have lower fuel and maintenance costs, as well as considerably lower annual operating costs and total costs of ownership. Electricity prices are more stable than gasoline and diesel prices, making budgeting for EVs much more accurate, and less subject to oil price shocks. Public fleet electrification would place Washington’s businesses, utilities, and governments on the leading edge of the EV revolution and help it remain competitive as the global trend towards vehicle electrification continues. Furthermore, as EV purchases increase, greater price reductions and technology improvements will occur for later buyers as EVs move through the experience curve and economies of scale are realized.While barriers to one hundred percent EV compliance still exist, EVs are practicable for much of our government fleets today. The state of Washington bought 125 all-electric Chevrolet Bolts for its fleet last year. King County Metro has purchased three electric buses, with plans to purchase 73 more by 2020, and to electrify its entire fleet by 2030. The City of Seattle has 175 EVs in its fleet, and recently opened a 156-unit EV charging facility in the municipal garage.Like all important changes to the status quo, the shift to electric fleets requires an engaged citizenry, civil servants dedicated to implementing the law, and vigilant oversight by elected officials. The law is already on the books and the technology is ready for deployment. It is time to embrace a clean future for our government fleets.Your support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

Washington State passes law establishing 2030 target for phasing out gasoline vehicles,"The Washington State legislature has passed groundbreaking legislation that sets a target for all model year 2030 or later passenger and light-duty vehicles sold in Washington State to be electric vehicles. The new law establishes the most aggressive state goal in the U.S. for moving to an all-electric future and puts Washington five years ahead of California’s 2035 target.Clean Cars 2030passed as an amendment toE2SHB 1287, a bill mandating electric utility preparation for an all-EV future, with a vote of 25-23 in the Senate and 54-43 in the House. It now heads to Gov. Jay Inslee’s desk for signature.First introduced in the legislature by Rep. Nicole Macri (D-Seattle) as HB 1204, the bill is now the first gasoline phaseout target to be passed through the legislative process.The Morning Wire: Keeping you informed on politics, policies, and personalities of Washington State.“With the passage of Clean Cars 2030, the end of the era of gasoline-powered cars is in sight,” said Matthew Metz, co-executive director ofColtura. “Clean Cars 2030 sets Washington on a nation-leading path consistent with climate science and an auto industry trend toward a fully-electric automotive future. We applaud Rep. Macri, Rep. Alex Ramel (D-Bellingham), and Sen. Marko Liias (D-Lynnwood) for their leadership on this bill, as well as the many other legislators who made history with their votes.”Passage of this legislation takes the guesswork and uncertainty out of the electric vehicle transition by creating a clear timeline with the data, tools, and guidelines we need to help businesses, developers, governments, and consumers plan with confidence,” said Sen. Liias. “Clean Cars 2030 is a critical step to meet urgent carbon reduction goals here in Washington and can serve as a model and impetus for other states to accelerate the switch to EVs.”Since Clean Cars 2030 was introduced to the legislature on January 14, the automotive industry has accelerated the shift away from gasoline cars. GM announced plans to sell only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035, Ford said it would only sell EVs in Europe by 2030, BMW’s MINI sub-division pledged to be EV-only by 2030, and Volvo committed to selling only EVs by 2030.The 2030 target will be integrated into planning and financial decision-making by a broad group of government, automaker, utility, and other stakeholders. It will take full effect when 75 percent of vehicles on the road are subject to a road usage charge, a development which is expected within the next several years.Coltura spearheaded adiverse coalitionof more than 25 organizations advocating for the bill’s passage, including leading environmental, social justice, and faith groups across the state. The date certain established in the bill for the transition away from gasoline vehicles also attracted the support of the automotive and business community, including an endorsement from the Washington State Auto Dealers Association.This news release was provided byColturaYour support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

Electric Vehicle Tax Break Extension Faces Stiff Challenges in a Cost-Conscious Legislature,"Consider the political oddity that is the electric vehicle sales tax exemption: Unless the Legislature acts this year, it expires July 1. A bipartisan group of legislators, known collectively as the electric vehicle caucus, has teamed up to extend it, which is something Gov. Jay Inslee is also pushing for.And yet, extending the exemption faces daunting legislative hurdles from two lawmakers whose politics couldn’t be further apart: Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler of Ritzville and House Finance Chairman Reuven Carlyle of Seattle.Schoesler said in a meeting with reporters Tuesday morning that the exemption will have to fit within the context of the state budget this year. Letting the tax preference sunset at the beginning of the fiscal year means the state can start banking the revenue it would have otherwise spent. The Department of Revenue,according to the Associated Press, estimated it costs about $13 million next year and $17 million in 2017, which depends on the number of electric vehicles sold.The tax break has been singled out by conservatives assimply a perk for the affluent,as the cars range in price from about $29,000 for a Nissan Leaf to $69,000 for a Tesla Model S, and even more for other models. Killing the tax exemption means more operating revenue for public schools or other budget needs.“We have to pause and wait and see on all of the tax exemptions,” Schoesler said. “Can we fit it in the budget box? How many jobs does it retain or create?”Carlyle also questioned the value of the tax incentive, and if the prospective electric car buyer would continue to make the purchase despite having to pay the sales tax on the car. He is aggressively targeting a wide swath of the state’s system of tax preferences.House Finance Chairman Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, on the House floor.“The electric vehicle exemption is a policy that is put in place to try to move behavior,” Carlyle said in an interview. “It’s important that we make it work for the public. I am reluctant to embrace the proverbial winners and losers, which our current tax system does.”THE EV CAUCUSThe diverse group of lawmakers, started by Sen. Mark Mullet, D-Issaquah, last fall, includes Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Burien, Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah, Sen. Andy Hill, R-Redmond, Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, Rep. Dick Muri, R-Steilacoom, Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, Sen. John McCoy, D-Tulalip, and Sen. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle.Magendanz said he believes more widespread adaptation of electric vehicles would be an effective deterrent against the fact that cars and trucks contribute about half of the state’s total carbon emissions. Magendanz, who majored in electrical engineering in college, said he owns an electric BMW and an electric motorcycle.It’s not just carbon dioxide, Magendanz notes. Tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks also account for majority of the heavy particulate, such as the soot that results from diesel combustion.Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah“From a market standpoint, we want to reduce those entry points as much as we can,” Magendanz said. “What we find with these tax incentives, they work. We want to kind of get that critical mass in the market to get the mass adoption.”It has drawbacks: A lack of charging stations in some areas of the state, and the fact that the battery charge makes it more suited for commuting than long distances. Gas prices have also plummeted in the last few months. An electric vehicle’s financial benefits will be a different proposition with gas at $2 a gallon than it was at $4, Magendanz notes.Yet, plug-in vehicle sales have grown on the national scale, from 17,735 total in 2011 to 118,773 in 2014, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association. According to the association, two years ago the U.S. had about 70,000 battery electric vehicles and 104,000 plug in hybrids, which compares to an overall figure of 226 million registered cars nationwide.Californialeads the nation with about half of all plug-inslocated within its borders, but Washington is the only other state to have a per-capita adoption rate of more than 3 electric vehicles per 1,000 registered cars.Electric vehicle registration by county; map courtesy the Department of Transportation.Michael Mann, a lobbyist who represents Nissan in Olympia, said he doesn’t want to see lawmakers letting the sales tax exemption expire based on the drop in the price of gasoline.“The price of gas has gone down but I don’t think many people are going to believe it’s going to stay down for a long time,” Mann said. “You’re making a 7 to 10-year financial investment. Nissan has been a leader in electric vehicles in Washington state. This incentive is one of the reasons.”LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALSThere’s currently two competing bills that would extend the sales tax exemption beyond July. One, requested by the governor and co-sponsored by Sens. Marko Liias, D-Mukilteo, and Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, wouldcap the amount of sales tax exemption at $60,000 per car, and extend the tax break to 2025.Another bill, co-sponsored by Hill, Mullet, McCoy, Sen. Karen Keiser, D-Kent, Litzow and Jayapal, wouldput the cap at $45,000and extend the break through 2021.Any additional sales tax revenue generated beyond that would go to an infrastructure bank to install more charging stations along the public highway system. Inslee has his own measure to create the infrastructure bank.His proposal would be funded through his cap-and-trade program, which is up against stiff opposition in the Legislature this year. But Carlyle credited the governor with proposing a revenue source for the exemption. Carlyle wrote on his Facebook page in December that he wanted to see offsetting revenue for electric vehicles’ sales tax exemption, which would amount to about $60 million over four years.He said Tuesday that he isn’t a “hard no” on extending the exemption, but wants to see measurable results from the tax break. Both the Inslee proposal and the one sponsored by Mullet would require theJoint Legislative Audit and Review Committeereview the tax incentive to measure performance, which can be a mixed bag in terms of getting quantifiable data. The sales tax exemption has been in place since 2005, and electric vehicle sales have taken off in recent years through technological advancements.“I am not a ‘hard no’ on any of the proposals coming before the Legislature,” Carlyle said. “If it’s something that’s going to happen regardless of what the state does, I’ve got to be…questioning of the value. The governor’s job is to propose. Our job is to debate or dispose.”Magendanz said he appreciated the fiscally responsible approach Carlyle is taking, but doesn’t want to see the Legislature move to something that would be short-sighted.“Reuven’s taken it upon himself to be a bit more aggressive,” Magendanz said. “I respect what he’s doing. We’re up against some pretty big challenges to fund McCleary. We don’t want to make shortsighted decisions that would harm the state in the long run.”Your support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

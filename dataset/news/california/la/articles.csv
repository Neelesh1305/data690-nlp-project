Pennsylvania regulators follow…,"Pennsylvania’s Peter Brothers Trucking delivers goods all across America. Owner Brian Wanner says Pennsylvania bureaucrats now are driving him out of his home state.“We have no say,” complains Wanner in mynew video. “We can’t do anything about it.”“No say” because Pennsylvania’s new rules don’t come from Pennsylvania. They come from California.“I don’t want to be anything like California!” complains Wanner.Too bad for him and other Pennsylvania truck owners, because Pennsylvania’s Environmental Quality Board decided their state will automatically copy California regulations.California’s rules will raise the price of a new truck by about one-third. Trucks that once cost $190,000 will now cost about $260,000.California regulators said this new air-pollution regulation is needed because the trucks Wanner drives “contribute greatly to … serious health and welfare problems.”That’s ridiculous, says Wanner. “We have come so far in the last 40 years. In 1980, one truck produced as much (pollution) as 60 trucks today.”“So to reduce pollution, wewantpeople to buynewtrucks,” I point out.“But if you put these costs on us that we cannot afford, we’re going to just run the older trucks!” responds Wanner.“The regulators don’t think about that?” I ask.“They do not!” Wanner replies. “They do not see the consequences of what they’re doing.”Now truckers like Wanner will just buy trucks in neighboring states.“We can go to Ohio and get cheaper trucks,” he says.So there won’t be any pollution reduction. The new rule will just hurt Pennsylvanians who sell trucks.Who are these regulators? Pennsylvania’s Environmental Quality Air Board is mostly made up of people from unrelated departments, like the Fish and Boat Commission, the Game Commission, the Historical & Museum Commission. I doubt that many know much about air pollution.“The whole idea of having a regulatory board like this is, ‘Oh, these people are experts,’” says attorney Caleb Kruckenberg of the Pacific Legal Foundation, “‘They know what they’re talking about. They’re smarter than the lawmakers.’ But if you look at the board, that’s not true. These are just random bureaucrats who work in the government, and they say, ‘I don’t know. Let’s follow California.’”Kruckenberg is suing Pennsylvania on behalf of truckers like Wanner, arguing that what Pennsylvania does violates the Constitution.“Nobody in Pennsylvania has ever voted for the standards that now control Pennsylvania.”I push back. “So what? California seems to have a lot of money. I could see a state saying, ‘Yeah, let their regulators figure out how we reduce pollution, and we’ll save money doing what they do.’”“If people want something,” Kruckenberg replies, “their legislature is supposed to pass it.”Related ArticlesOpinion |SCOTUS to put the administrative state under scrutinyOpinion |Public school advocates should embrace open enrollmentOpinion |When it’s always the beginning of history, it can never be the end of warOpinion |‘Assault weapons’ bans are indeed unconstitutional (and bad policy)Opinion |Guardians or gangsters?: The dark side of civil asset forfeitureCalifornia’s rules will soon get still more expensive because Gov. Gavin Newsom has decreed that soon, all new vehicles must be electric.“But electricity comes from fossil fuels!” Kruckenberg points out. In Pennsylvania, some comes from coal, and most comes from natural gas.So to power all-electric trucks, Pennsylvania will burn more fossil fuels.Still another problem: electric trucks are heavier.“That’s harder on the roads,” says Wanner. Also, “electric trucks have a very low mileage radius, so you can’t work all day. It’s nothing that you can take across the United States.”Pennsylvania’s regulators don’t seem to care. They just want to do what California does.“Why would we allow our state to give away their lawmaking procedures to California?” asks Wanner. “That’s not the American way. If we want to follow California, we can move there!

Proposed tax credit could help landscapers…,"When Sana Sirodan and her team launched Greenplace landscaping services out of Costa Mesa earlier this year after immigrating from Ukraine due to the war, she said they opted for all-electric equipment from the start.They knew their new home state of California was pivoting away from polluting leaf blowers, lawn mowers and other gear with engines powered by pricey gasoline or diesel, Sirodan said. Electric tools also are quieter, a bit easier to operate and less expensive over time. And Greenplace now pitches their all-electric fleet of tools as an “eco-friendly” selling point for customers throughout Orange and Los Angeles counties.But for established landscape businesses, such as Marques Blackman’s Simple Lawns Services in San Bernardino, which have already invested hundreds or thousands of dollars in more powerful gas-fueled tools, coming up with the capital to switch to electric equipment is no small feat.Commercial-grade electric-powered gear can cost anywhere from 15% to 300% more upfront, before factoring in the cost of batteries, chargers and potential electrical upgrades needed to keep them running all day. And that financial hit will fall disproportionately on immigrant and non-White residents, who make up higher shares of lawn care workers in Southern California and beyond.That’s why Rep. Lou Correa, D-Santa Ana, introduced a bill that, if adopted, would let professional gardeners and landscapers claim a new business tax credit to recoup some of what they spend to upgrade to zero-emission equipment.“I grew up in Orange County,” Correa said by phone Friday, as he walked to a caucus meeting at the Capitol. “In the ’60s and ’70s, there were summer days that you couldn’t go outside and play because the air quality was horrible. And if you did, you’d be coughing for the rest of the week, and you’d have chest pains for the rest of the week, because of the polluted air.”So Correa said he fully supports efforts to continue improving local air quality. He just wants to make sure that some of the most vulnerable members of our communities aren’t “unduly” paying the price for changes that benefit everyone.Joe Conrad, president of Mean Green Mowers, gives a demonstration of zero-emission, battery-electric commercial lawnmowers that will be used at San Manuel Stadium in this file photo.

Regulations in California will ban the sale of new gas-powered mowers and other landscape equipment starting Jan. 1, 2023. (Photo by Mark Rightmire, Orange County Register/SCNG)Show CaptionofExpandTraditional lawn equipment relies on two-stroke engines, which burn a dirty mix of fuel and oil. Operating a commercial leaf blower for one hour puts out the same level of smog-forming pollution as driving a car from Los Angeles to Denver, per theCalifornia Air Resources Board, with total emissions from these small off-road engines already exceeding emissions from light-duty passenger cars in California.That exhaust has been found to contribute to headaches, asthma and other respiratory symptoms.“Pollution impacts everyone’s health, but it is particularly dangerous for those who spend time outdoors like children or the outdoor workers operating the equipment,” said Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association, in a statement supporting Correa’s bill.The noise from gas leaf blowers, in particular, is also a problem for wildlife and for people’s quality of life.With such effects in mind, California air quality regulatorsvotedin December 2021 to ban the sale of new gas-powered leaf blowers, lawn mowers, weed trimmers and chainsaws starting Jan. 1, 2024. New power washers and portable generators will have to be zero-emission starting in 2028.The rules don’t apply to existing gas-powered equipment, which will still be legal to use or resell in California.California isn’t alone in tackling these loud, polluting tools. There are more than 300 restrictions on gas-powered lawn equipment across the country, according to data collected by the National Association of Landscape Professionals.The association “fully supports the responsible transition” from gas to electric equipment, said Andrew Bray, vice president of Government Relations for the trade group. But Bray said their members just want more time and resources to make the switch. That’s why they’ve signed on to support Correa’s bill, joining a diverse and growing coalition of backers that includes environment, health and business groups, from landscapers to golf courses.Under Correa’s bill, landscape businesses could write off up to 40% of what they spent the prior year to buy emission-free gear, including plug-in or cordless tools plus any batteries or chargers that power those tools. The credit also can be used to help upgrade existing equipment to make it zero-emission. Businesses could get up to $25,000 back on purchases each year, for no more than $100,000 in credits over a 10-year period. And the credit would apply to any equipment purchased on or after Jan. 1, 2023.Gas-powered tools have been such an industry standard that Blackman said he didn’t even consider buying electric gear when he worked his way up from doing landscaping as a chore growing up to doing it as a side hustle to launching his own business five years ago. He’s been reading about the coming switch to electric equipment, though, and has been setting aside money for when he has to buy new gear.“That’s going to be hard on a lot of people that have other expenses,” he said. “But as a business owner, you have to adapt with the times, you know, and be like a chameleon.”He also noted that, much like with an electric vehicle, buying electric landscaping equipment tends to be more expensive upfront and become cheaper over time.The price for consumer-grade, handheld leaf blowers is now about the same whether they’re gas and electric. But for commercial gear, an electric backpack leaf blower might cost $100 or more than a comparable gas version, while an electric sit-down lawn mower might cost $30,000 vs. a $12,000 gas-powered version. Gas tools are more powerful, too, Blackman said. And landscapers who use them don’t yet need to worry about upgrading electrical systems in their shops to handle the voltage needed to charge zero-emissions gear.But electric tools require much less maintenance, since they don’t have the same complex moving parts. They also don’t require pricey oil, gasoline or diesel to operate.To care for 60 lawns throughout the San Bernardino area this past week, Blackman said he spent about $200 in gasoline for his equipment.Electric gear is also a bit lighter, with no chain to pull to start it up. And Sirodan said they don’t have to worry as much aboutdisturbing customersor their neighbors even when they start work early, since the tools are much quieter.Despite the broad coalition of support for his bill, Correa acknowledged it will likely be tough to get this tax credit added to Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.“There’s a lot of people in Congress, on the other side of the aisle primarily, that don’t won’t support any tax credits for going green,” he said.“But we’re not playing the odds. We’re advocating for what’s right for our taxpayers, our small businesses in our district.”Related ArticlesEnvironment |EPA to consider making regional warehouse pollution rule federally enforceableEnvironment |Can a sponge-like ‘nanomaterial’ eat up greenhouse gas?

Tesla prices rival average US cars after…,"By Tom Randall| BloombergTesla Inc.’s top-selling electric vehicles now compete directly with gasoline cars on price after the latest round of price reductions. The lower prices could cost the company $1.2 billion a year, according to at least one investor.At $38,990, the base Model 3 sedan now costs $8,700 less than the average amount paid for a car or truck in the US. The starting price for a Model Y SUV is $3,700 below the average auto price of roughly $48,000, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Green. Tesla started cutting prices at the start of the year, twisting the screws on legacy automakers that were already struggling to make electric vehicles profitably.Also see:UC Riverside grad sues Elon Musk for defamation over posts that falsely ID’d him in protest“Now the fun part of cost declines … life after price parity,” said Sam Korus, an analyst at Ark Investment Management, which manages funds with approximately $1.27 billion in Tesla stock. “There is no reason why battery costs or EVs should halt their price declines at price parity. The product can continue to cost less, or it continues to sit in the same price segment and performance improves.”While Tesla’s share price was little changed by the cuts last week, the drumbeat of reductions this year has driven a wedge between some investors. Gary Black, managing partner at The Future Fund, said last week’s changes alone will cost Tesla $1.2 billion a year starting in 2024.Also see:Tesla tells jurors fatal crash in Menifee had nothing to do with AutopilotBlack has used his widely followed X social media account to advocate for Tesla to spend money on traditional advertising campaigns rather than price cuts. Amazes me that Tesla uber-bulls [are] trying to spin last night’s price cuts as positive,” Black posted on Oct. 6. “We would prefer Tesla use long-term advertising investment to educate [internal combustion engine] owners to go EV rather than price cuts.”The Model 3’s starting price is now $6,500 less than the cheapest BMW 3 Series, which is often seen as the Tesla sedan’s most direct gasoline-powered competitor. Adding in a $7,500 federal EV incentive and fuel savings puts the cost of ownership on par with a 2024 Toyota Corolla.More on EVs:California’s electric-car sales spike shows uprising headed for USTesla has also dropped the price of its higher-end vehicles, the Model S full-size sedan and Model X three-row SUV, both of which are at their cheapest ever compared to the US average transaction price.

Why can’t Americans buy cheap Chinese…,"By Kyle Stock | BloombergEV variety is easy to find outside the US. Where American drivers now have about 50 electric cars to choose from, Europe’s array is almost double that, and China’s nearly triple. With that variety come more small and midsize options, and more cars with price tags that won’t break the bank.Ask any US automaker and they’ll say this is mainly a profitability problem. To pay for investments in electrification, carmakers are first focusing on trucks, SUVs and other premium models. That same tension is at the center of the United Auto Workers strike, which is pitting factory workers looking to preserve pay and benefits in an EV world against carmakers who say they can’t go electric, meet union demands and stay in the black.A model stands next to the newly launched BYD Atto 3 car during the Auto Expo 2023 in Greater Noida on January 11, 2023. (Photo by Money Sharma/AFP via Getty Images)China, meanwhile, has become a global powerhouse in electric cars: It’s expected to account for about 60% of the world’s 14.1 million new passenger EV sales this year, according to BloombergNEF. Many of those options are small and affordable; some are downright cheap. Take BYD’s Atto 3, a small, front-wheel-drive crossover with one of the most advanced batteries in the game. The Atto 3 costs just $20,000 in China and starts at $38,000 in the UK and Europe. But not a single Atto 3 is headed for the US market.Why not? The answer is part logistics and part politics.Although the US has a strong track record of mainstreaming foreign cars — Toyota is one of the country’s most popular brands — the challenges of entering such a competitive market are hard to overstate. All foreign automakers do so at a disadvantage, starting with a 2.5% tariff on most imports. But in two categories that disadvantage is substantial enough to almost entirely stamp out foreign competition: pickup trucks and cars made in China.Since a 1964 spat over European tariffs on poultry, the US has levied a 25% tax on imported trucks, now known as the “chicken tax.” That surcharge largely cleared the road for Detroit’s truck titans — at least until Japanese brands established US factories to get around it — and today means tricky economics for any foreign automaker looking to crack the lucrative American truck market.The China dynamic is more recent. In 2018, just as China was starting to crank out a wave of compact EVs, US president Donald Trump implemented tariffs on about $370 billion of imports from the country each year, including a 27.5% tariff on cars made in China. That policy persists under the Biden administration. In Europe, by contrast, the tariff on Chinese cars is 9% — low enough for those machines to at least trickle into the market.“If you have a 20% to 25% cost advantage, it makes sense to go to countries where even after the tariff you are price-competitive,” Aakash Arora, a managing director in Boston Consulting Group’s auto practice, told Bloomberg News.But tariffs are just the first hurdle for a global car company looking to crack the US market. Most Chinese cars haven’t been engineered with US safety regulations in mind; just going through those protocols is an expensive and elaborate process. Then there’s the cost of building a retail network and some sort of safety net for servicing cars and backstopping warranties.Dave Andrea, a principal at Michigan-based consultancy Plante Moran, compares the US auto market to a siren song: compelling until you get close enough to see the risks. “It’s a big market, but not a growing market per se,” he says. “And you have to displace existing manufacturers, existing brand loyalty.”A Lucid electric vehicle sits parked at a charging station outside of a Lucid Studio on March 29, 2023 in Corte Madera, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Newcomers must pour enough money into marketing to get some semblance of name recognition — a tall order for foreign companies and EV upstarts alike. California-based Lucid Group, a startup that makes the longest-range electric car in the US, saw brand awareness as important enough to spring for a commercial during this year’s Oscars (at an estimated cost of $2 million).Even established foreign brands struggle for relevance with American buyers. “You could argue Fiat has been a bust in America,” says Kevin Tynan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Mitsubishi’s done nothing, Isuzu’s gone and Mazda’s probably hanging on by its fingernails.”​If Chinese carmakers were somehow able to overcome tariff economics, dealer-network logistics and marketing hurdles, they would still face another challenge in the US. There may be a decent chance of American consumers going for a Chinese EV, but there’s almost no chance of US politicians supporting an auto-market evolution that benefits Chinese companies over American ones.“Trump put [the China tariff] on there honestly in a fit of pique, but it’s going to stay,” says economist Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. “In Washington right now, they’ll go after anything that looks like it’s got a Chinese component.”A flavor of this tension is already playing out in the European Union, where Chinese brands accounted for an estimated 8% share of EVs last year, according to an EU official. In a bid to ward off a flood of cheap imports, the European Commission on Sept. 13 launched an investigation into China’s EV subsidies. President Ursula von der Leyen said prices for Chinese electric cars are “kept artificially low by huge state subsidies,” which “is distorting our market.”For the US EV market, what comes next hinges in part on the UAW negotiations. This year through August, US factories made about 7 million cars and trucks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data, almost two thirds of which came from union plants.If the carmakers concede to the union on higher pay, Tynan expects they will in turn negotiate for a smaller, more flexible workforce, which would lock in fewer car models, fewer cars and higher prices. “If I can sell less and make more, that’s the whole point,” he says.In short, Detroit is drifting further and further from the starter car, while factories in China are specializing in it. Just don’t expect the latter to solve for the former anytime soon.More stories like this are available onbloomberg.com©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","September 22, 2023 at 12:04 p.m.",california-la

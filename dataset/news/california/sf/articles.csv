"Environmental groups want SF to nudge Uber, Lyft drivers toward electric vehicles","Environmental advocates want San Francisco to find ways to make electric vehicles more attractive to Uber and Lyft drivers at the same time they consider a per-ride tax on the companies that is meant to ease congestion. In recent weeks, at least five organizations, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, Coalition for Clean Air and the San Francisco League of Conservation Voters, have sent letters to Mayor London Breed and the Board of Supervisors urging them to include tax breaks to push Uber and Lyft drivers toward zero-emission vehicles. Led by Supervisor Aaron Peskin, city officials are fine-tuning the language of a ballot measure that would tax each Uber and Lyft ride that originates in San Francisco. It’s expected to appear on the Nov. 5 ballotand already has the support of the two ride-hail companies.The measure is expected to place a 3.25 percent tax on single rides and a 1.5 percent tax on shared rides. The San Francisco County Transportation Authority would receive the estimated $30 million in revenue to spend on local transit projects. The environmental groups are advocating for some kind of tax treatment that would reward drivers who use electric vehicles, but exactly how that would work has not been outlined. Their goal is to have the city meet itsgoal of being a net-zero carbon emitterby 2050. But questions remain about how to implement the tax break and how the city would install the charging stations needed if a significant portion of Uber’s and Lyft’s fleets shifted to electric vehicles. It’s not clear how many would be needed, but the city currently has just under 796 publicly available charging ports. “The time for thinking and the time for studying and debate — we’re well past that. We need programs that help us electrify everything,” said Dan Jacobson, state director for Environment California, one of the organizations that wrote to city officials. “Electrifying the car-share rides should be a very low-hanging fruit program we can do here in the city, and one that should be adopted throughout the state.” Much of the tax measure is predicated on a2017 reportfrom the county transportation authority that found that there were around 170,000 ride-hailing trips on a typical San Francisco weekday. Peskin said he’s planning to add a temporary tax incentive for zero-emission vehicles into the ballot measure but emphasized that, at its core, the per-ride tax is intended to raise money for transit projects and reduce congestion attributable to Uber and Lyft. “We want to incentivize zero-emission vehicles, but at the end of the day, we want to dis-incentivize congestion,” Peskin said. “We’re going to give zero-emission vehicles a running head start. We want to incentivize them so they’re encouraged to be part of the Uber and Lyft fleets, but that doesn’t mean they get a tax holiday forever.” Peskin added that he hopes to put the measure on the November ballot with a unanimous vote of the board and the backing of the mayor. “I’m all for it. Any way to incentivize people to go electric, I’m all for it,” said Esther de Frutos,who drives for Uber in San Francisco in her electric Chevy Bolt. The ability to tax Uber and Lyft rides to fund transportation projects was cemented by 2018 legislation authored by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco. His bill, AB1184, included provisions that allowed city officials to create tax breaks for zero-emission vehicles, but didn’t mandate them. “I’m a champion of clean cars,” Ting said. An enticement to move toward zero-emission vehicles, he said, was “something I’d encourage Supervisor Peskin to incorporate” into the ballot measure. Another 2018 bill, from state Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, requires the California Air Resources Board and the California Public Utilities Commission to find ways to increase the number of electric vehicles in the ride-hailing fleets and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile. Both Uber and Lyft have made some attempts to reward their drivers who use electric vehicles. Davis White, Uber’s director of California public affairs, pointed toprogramsthat give drivers a warning if an upcoming rider’s trip might take 30 minutes or more, a nod to the shorter distances most electric vehicles can cover before needing a charge. In some cities, including San Francisco, Uber also gives small cash incentives to electric-vehicle drivers. Last month, Lyft announced its intent to “introduce thousands of electric vehicles onto our platform,” and make it easier to request electric-vehicle rides. It’s not clear how far along the company is toward those goals, as a Lyft spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Neither environmentalists nor local policymakers have a firm sense of how the zero-emission tax break might actually work. Some have suggested making electric-vehicle rides available each time someone hails an Uber or Lyft ride, or allowing electric-vehicle drivers to keep more of the money from each fare. Though he asked the mayor and the board for the electric-vehicle tax break, Jimmy O’Dea, a senior vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said whatever is added to Peskin’s ballot measure probably won’t be “a strong enough incentive” to influence drivers’ decisions meaningfully. “But at least it starts a bigger conversation that maybe wasn’t happening before,” he said. “It forces the city’s hand on the (charging station) question. If they portray to be supporting electric-vehicles, they have to go all the way and think about infrastructure as well, and not just a lower rate on the fees they collect.” Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

"To cut carbon footprint, SF moves to eliminate vehicle emissions by 2040","San Francisco officials want to shrink the city’s carbon footprint by eliminating the greenhouse gases belched from cars, trucks and other vehicles by 2040. The city will take the first step toward that goal Tuesday, when MayorLondon Breedand SupervisorsVallie BrownandAaron Peskinare expected to introduce legislation to install more electric-vehicle charging stations in both public and private parking lots and garages. Exhaust from cars, trucks and other vehicles represents 46% of all emissions in San Francisco, making transportation the biggest contributor to the city’s carbon footprint. About 44% of emissions come equally from the fuel burned to power and heat commercial and residential buildings, according to the city’s Department of the Environment. City officials have also introduced legislation that would requirelarge commercial property ownersto switch their buildings to 100% renewable energy by 2030. That ordinance is waiting for a hearing before the city’s Land Use Committee. Leaders in San Francisco and across the state are looking to boost the adoption of electric vehicles — and the charging infrastructure needed to encourage drivers to make the switch. In 2018, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order calling for 5 million new zero-emission vehicles on California’s roads by 2030 and 250,000 charging stations by 2025. “To meet our climate goals and improve the air we breathe, we need to electrify public and private transportation,” Breed said in a statement. “We know that one of the biggest barriers for people considering driving an electric vehicle is access to charging, so we want to make sure our city has the charging infrastructure that’s needed.” San Francisco’s pending legislation, which city officials believe to be the first of its kind in the country, would require private parking lots and garages with more than 100 parking spots to install electric-vehicle charging stations next to at least 10% of the spaces. The ordinance would apply to about 300 commercial parking facilities in the city whose owners would have until 2023 to install the new stations. Commercial electric-vehicle charging stations can cost thousands of dollars each. But most private lot and garage operators are expected to contract with charging-station providers, so the charging ports don’t have to be bought outright. The city is also looking to grow the stock of charging stations at up to 38 municipally operated lots and garages. Charging-station providers are bidding on the chance to install up to 340 charging ports on city property. The city has installed 200 charging ports on city property since 2009. Beyond installing more charging stations, the city will consider other proposals meant to nudge more people into electric vehicles, including making street and garage parking cheaper for electric cars, finding ways to make at-home charging more affordable, and finding ways to shift heavier vehicles — like school buses and garbage trucks — to all-electric fleets. — Dominic Fracassa  Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

"With new grant program, Bay Area spreads electric cars to low-income drivers","This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate Standing beside his new car, a 2016 Ford C-Max hybrid with an eggshell-white exterior, Ignacio Hernandez beams. Charge the electric battery and it glides for 200 miles, swooshing along the Interstate 880 and Interstate 580 freeways from Hernandez’s home in East Oakland to his job managing a Burger King in Dublin. It purrs so quietly that Hernandez barely hears the motor, and in the long run, it will save him money: His old car, a sputtering, 1996 Toyota Camry, cost thousands of dollars a year for gas and repairs. But purchasing a hybrid was unthinkable until Hernandez got a $9,500 grant from Bay Area Air Quality Management District, through a program that aims to make clean-air vehicles accessible to low-income Californians. “Definitely cost is one of the biggest barriers to getting people in these vehicles,” said Rebecca Fisher, a program manager at the district who is helping steer Clean Cars for All. Funded with state climate investments and money from a one-time $10 million payment from a civil enforcement case against Volkswagen — which agreed to pay billions in penalties after the company admitted to cheating on diesel emissions standards — the program subsidizes new electric vehicles for qualifying motorists willing to scrap their clunkers. The old, polluting cars get hauled to a recycling plant and eviscerated, so their metal shells and parts can be salvaged. California directs a portion of its climate funding toward low-income or “disadvantaged” communities, often located in areas that are heavily polluted by automobiles, said Melanie Turner, a spokeswoman for the state’s Air Resources Board. Aside from helping finance electric vehicles, the state also pays for rural school buses, zero-emission car shares, and van pools to serve agricultural workers, among other projects. The Clean Cars for All program in the Bay Area started in March and has assisted nearly 200 people who were driving old beaters, including some that date to the 1980s, Fisher said. Air districts in Sacramento, Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley have launched similar efforts, all bolstered by the state climate funds. Fisher said the programs can continue in perpetuity if the Legislature approves them in every budget. In the Bay Area, air quality officials hand out grants of up to $9,500 for the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, along with up to $2,000 to install a home charger. To qualify, applicants must meet an income threshold that’s about twice the federal poverty line — a family of four must make less than $58,000 a year to receive the maximum grant. Recipients who choose to buy a new car can also receive a state rebate of $2,500, which won’t apply to purchases of used vehicles. For those who want an alternative to driving, Clean Cars also offers subsidies for Clipper Cards — policymakers hope to expand the program to e-bikes next year. The idea is that efficient transportation can be a means to economic mobility: “We’re providing people who are struggling financially with a more reliable way to get to work,” Fisher said. Officials also want to spread the electric car market beyond Silicon Valley and well-heeled Bay Area suburbs. Though some politicians tout electric cars and trucks as a solution to California’s problems with air pollution, the state is struggling to get more of these vehicles on the road. Cost is at least partly to blame. Electric cars are specialty items: Mass-market brands like the $30,000 Nissan Leaf are still too expensive for most people, even with a federal tax credit and the state rebate. The state set an ambitious goal to put 5 million motorists in clean-air cars by 2030, but the number still hovers at 600,000 today. As policymakers offer incentives to low-income communities, they’re confronting another problem: the widespread perception that plug-in vehicles are only for affluent people. “Moderately priced, used vehicles actually aren’t a bad deal, but people get so nervous about them,” said Joel Levin, executive director of the nonprofit consumer group Plug In America. “If you don’t know anyone who drives an electric vehicle, then it’s harder to see yourself inside of one.” Working-class people tend to be the most dependent on automobiles, because many of them live in suburbs, rural areas, or inner-city pockets that aren’t well served by public transportation. Many also cut down their transportation spending by driving older, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Hernandez, for instance, clung to his ’96 Camry for six years, even though it burned too much oil, its motor and transmission were periodically breaking and it required major repairs just to pass smog checks. Eventually, even his mechanic advised that a new car would be more cost-effective. One day in April, Hernandez was watching the Spanish-language Telemundo channel when a public service announcement for the Clean Cars program caught his eye. “It was some kind of destiny,” he said. “I don’t usually watch the news in Spanish.” He quickly applied and bought the Ford C-Max in June from Rose Motors in Castro Valley. The car cost $16,000, and Hernandez’s monthly payments are $159 for 2½ years. But he saves significantly on gas, paying $25 every 11 days to fill the hybrid, instead of $40 every eight to 10 days for the Camry. And numerous reports show that the cost of maintaining electric vehicles tends to be lower than gas vehicles. For Hernandez and others, the grants have been transformative. Berkeley resident Sean Burns said he traded a dilapidated 2003 Mercedes-Benz for an electric 2016 Volkswagen e-Golf. The Air Quality Management District supplied $5,500 for the car and $2,000 to install a charger in his landlord’s driveway — Burns lives with his wife and kids in a backyard granny flat. He’d always had a sixth sense for finding deals on used cars — “I’d never bought anything that’s not at least 15 years old, and under $3,000,” Burns said — but with the rising urgency of climate change, he and his wife, Claire, thought that switching to an electric vehicle “was the right thing to do.” They bought the new car in late November. With the subsidy, it cost $9,000 after taxes. “It was the coolest car, and we just bought it outright,” Burns said. “We’re elated.” Rachel Swan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Berkeley considers banning the sale of gas-powered cars by 2027. But is it feasible?,"This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate Berkeley is taking steps to ban the sale of gas-powered cars like these starting in 2027. An electric vehicle charging station at the Berkeley Marina. A mechanic at the McKevitt dealership in Berkeley works on a gas-powered car. Berkeley is considering banning the sale of cars powered by gasoline, diesel and natural gas by 2027 in a bid to combat climate change. The City Council is expected to direct the city manager on Jan. 19 to do a feasibility study before considering an ordinance that would phase out 80% of gasoline, diesel and natural gas passenger vehicle sales. The future ordinance would not apply to trucks. Berkeley would also stop purchasing these vehicles and convert its fleet of 129 vehicles to all electric. But not all Berkeley officials think the plan is feasible. Mayor Jesse Arreguín said he’s not sure that 2027 is a “realistic timeline” for banning gas-, natural gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, though he praised the effort to lead on climate change. It’s worth noting the ban would be confined to Berkeley’s city limits, which means consumers who want to purchase a gas-powered vehicle would just have to go to nearby Oakland. Some vehicle operators expressed skepticism about requiring car sales to go electric so soon. “I don’t think it’s feasible to think that you can actually end oil and gas,” said Jerry Griggs, the operations manager at Buggy Bank LLC, a display car service — a middleman between dealers and consumers — in Berkeley. “There are some pretty wackadoo things going on in politics right now. Those people are supposed to be smarter than us and they think it can happen, but I don’t see it.” The BMW dealership in Berkeley declined to comment. Toyota and Chrysler in Berkeley did not respond to a request for comment. The city’s efforts come afterGov. Gavin Newsom announced in September that Californiawill ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Newsom signed an executive order mandating that beginning in that year, new passenger vehicles sold must be zero-emission. Zero-emission vehicles include battery-powered electric cars and vehicles that run on hydrogen fuel cells. The California Air Resources Board will develop a plan that ensures new vehicles for sale will be mostly zero-emission leading up to 2035. Some Berkeley officials say 2035 is too late. “The transportation sector is the sector that we have tackled the least in some ways, and it is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases that we have,” said Councilwoman Kate Harrison. The push from Harrison and other council members comes after former Councilwoman Cheryl Davila introduced the vehicle sales ordinance in December. That ordinance is on hold until city staff conduct the feasibility study. Davila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration challenged California’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by banning the sale of gas-powered cars, calling it a job killer. But environmentalists hope the Biden administration will embrace California’s push. “Our hope is the Biden administration will come in ... and undo some of the damage Trump tried to do,” said Paul Cort, a staff attorney and director at Earthjustice. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association that represents GM and Fiat Chrysler, did not respond to a request for comment. Arreguín expressed concerns that auto dealerships are a “sizable portion” of the city’s tax base and how the ban would affect the city’s revenue streams. Harrison argued that the city would make up the lost revenue if current dealerships transition to selling electric vehicles. In addition, Arreguín said the city also needs to ensure certain streets are more accessible for people biking and using other forms of transportation. And any transition to electric must be equitable, he said. The city may look into imposing a tax on vehicle sales of over $30,000 to fund climate initiatives — a possibility that Arreguín said he is open to exploring. Berkeley’s ordinance would likely be applied to vehicles on a staggered timeline. Those valued at more than $28,000 would be phased out by 2025, more than $23,000 by 2026 and all others by 2027, according to a staff report. Berkeley has long paved the way for radical environmental policies. In 2019,Berkeley became the first city in the United Statesto ban the installation of natural gas lines in new homes.Many cities have since adopted similar bans. That same year, Berkeley banned single-use disposables, requiring restaurants to use compostable to-go packaging and utensils There is no timeline for when the council will vote on an ordinance to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.

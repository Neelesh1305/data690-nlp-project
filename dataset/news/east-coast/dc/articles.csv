Are electric cars really better for the environment?,"Electric vehicles, you might have heard, have a mineral problem. Beneath the floor of an EV sits a900-pound batteryfilled with minerals extracted from around the world. Millions of tons of lithium, cobalt, bauxite and other minerals are mined, processed, shipped and refined — sometimes leaving atrail of human rights and environmental abuses. For some, that makes fossil fuel engines look good by comparison. No one wants to drive around on thecobalt equivalent of blood diamonds. But does all this mining negate the climate and environmental benefits of EVs compared to sticking with gas? I looked into the world’s evolving supply chains for the clean-energy economy. In every scenario, it turns out, the demand for battery minerals represents a tiny fraction of the amounts of fossil fuels now needed to power the world. But not everything is measured in tons. For EVs to fulfill their clean-energy promise, they need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the first Industrial Revolution. Miners and manufacturers can embrace cleaner ways to get the materials they need, and recover more of what they use. Here’s how EVs and gasoline cars stack up. Almost all cars require steel, aluminum, copper, plastic, rubber and glass. Where EVs differ most from conventional vehicles is in their battery packs. Atypical 200-mile range EVlugs around a lithium-ion battery pack that’s nearly a third of the weight of the vehicle. Much of that weight is the battery pack’s casing, structural materials and aliquid electrolytethat ferries electrons around to charge and discharge the battery. But roughly 353 pounds are crucial minerals or metals, including cobalt, nickel, manganese, graphite, aluminum and copper,estimates Transport and Environment, a nongovernmental organization campaigning for cleaner transport. Not counting steel and aluminum, says MIT, anEV requires six times more minerals than a conventional vehicle. We will need a massive increase in these materials in the coming years. Global EV sales are predicted to surpass gas-vehicle sales in just over a decade after havingblown past early projections.General Motors, Volkswagen, Volvo, Hyundai and Hondacommitted to electrifying their lineup. With jurisdictions from California to theEuropean Unionprohibiting the sale of most new fossil fuel vehiclesby 2035, thevast majority of new passenger vehiclesare likely to be electric well before mid-century. That will mean expanding today’s mines and launching new ones. “The volume is large and it’s going to get very large,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science at the University of California at Berkeley. Gigafactories springing up around the world to build batteries are already straining the volume of clean-energy minerals the mining industry can produce. Mining minerals is never a clean affair. Cobalt from Congo, lithium and graphite from China, nickel from Indonesia and Russia, and battery supply chains thatrun through Xinjiang, in the Uyghur regionwhere forced labor has been rampant: All of these have immediate problems, which The Washington Post explored in our “Clean Cars, Hidden Toll” series. Guinea, home to the world’s largest bauxite reserves for aluminum,yields misery for local communities. Nickel refiners in Indonesia areadopting a risky technology. Mineworkers in South Africa, the world’s largest producer of manganese,face neurological ills. These environmental and social problems are real. But compared to the track record of the oil, gas and coal industry, they are a drop in the barrel. To compare EVs with conventional vehicles, first we need to look at how much stuff we pull out of the ground tomake and fuel them. Mining minerals for the clean-energy economy is measured in millions of tons per year. For fossil fuel extraction, that’s a rounding error. In 2020, building the world’s wind turbines, solar panels, EVs and other clean-energy infrastructure demanded 7 million tons of minerals,estimates the International Energy Agency. Roughly half of this was destined for batteries and EVs. The oil, gas and coal industry, by contrast, extracted the equivalent of15 billion metric tonsin 2019. And the industry will need to extract it year after year to keep supplying energy. Clean-energy technology can use these materials for decades or, if recycled, in perpetuity. “That’s a point we’ve been trying to make for a long time,” says Kwasi Ampofo, the head of metals and mining at BloombergNEF,aclean-energy research groupin London. “Even on a volumetric basis, it’s important to highlight the fact that fossil fuels are not comparable.” That remains true even if EVs and batteries were part of a massive, global transition to clean energy. In a scenario limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, the IEA estimates the amount of critical minerals needed would be roughly 500 times less in terms of volume than today’s fossil fuel extraction. Of course, material mined isn’t a perfect gauge of environmental damage. Local environmental effects tend to scale with the amount of stuff we pull out of theground. Extracting 1 ton of copper, for example, requires digging uparound 100 tons of ore. But even accounting for this, estimates Sam Calisch, a scientist at the nonprofit Rewiring America,mining minerals for the clean-energy economy amounts to extracting about five times less matter than what’s extracted by the fossil fuel industry. “This is still massive,” Calisch says. EVs already emitless than a thirdof the emissions per mile than their gasoline counterparts, on average, if you’re plugging into America’s electricity mix. But what if you account for emissions from mining metals, manufacturing, refueling and disposal of EVs? Noah Horesh, a researcher at Colorado State University who studies life cycle emissions in the transportation sector, has analyzed vehicles’ emissions over their life spans. Horesh estimates fossil fuel vehicles generate roughly twice the emissions of an EV, even accounting for emissions from extracting added minerals and metals. This difference will only grow as the electricity sectordecarbonizes, and battery manufacturingbecomes far more efficient. People recharging with clean electricity, or driving smaller vehicles, may already see a bigger difference today. Air pollution, one of theworld’s leading killers, will decrease as well. Fossil fuels are responsible for 4 million to8 millionexcess deathseach year tied to air pollution, reportstudies in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academies of ScienceandEnvironmental Research. Cleaning up the mineral supply chain for batteries, unlike the oil industry, remains a distinct possibility. The Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes automakers to use mineral supply chains in the United States or countries with close trade relations. Mining companies are being pushed, or forced, to clean up their act as buyers, automakers and countries demand more transparent supply chains. New technology is also reducing negative impacts. None of this is guaranteed.Lead the Charge, an advocacy network tracking the supply chains of the world’s leading automakers, says many are making progress on their efforts to eliminate emissions, environmental harms and human rights violations. “But as an industry,” it says, “there is a long way to go.” You cansee their leader board of automakers here. Still, we’re starting to see some changes. Researchers and battery makers are racing to replace nickel and cobalt with metals such as manganese and iron that are safer, abundant, nontoxic and cheap. “There are only a few metals at the intersection of what we can use and what we produce a lot of,” says Ceder. “But we’re seeing significant progress in that area.” Manufacturers now usesix times less cobaltin EV batteries, or have eliminated it entirely in recent years. Last year, half of the vehicles Tesla sold in the first quartercontained batteries with no cobalt or nickel. Recycling already holds great promise. Today,only about 5 percent of lithium-ion batteriesacross all products are recycled in the U.S. Within a few decades, accordingto the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation, the vast majority of EV batteries will likely be collected and repurposed for a second life such as grid energy storage, or recycled, cutting the EV demand for minerals by about a third. Lead-acid car batteries provide a model: an estimated 99 percent are recycled. That has created a nearly closed loop for reusing lead, report researchers inthe peer-reviewed journal American Economic Review: Insights. “The transition to low-carbon fuels is not a magic bullet with no negative outcome,"" says Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist at MIT. “There is no free lunch. But it’s much less harmful than if we stay with fossil fuels. That’s the conclusion.”","September 19, 2023 at 6:30 a.m. EDT",washington-post,east-coast
Electric Vehicles Alone Can’t Solve Climate Change,"Arresting climate change requires, among other things, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. But managing the transition from gas-powered cars won’t be easy. President Joe Biden’s administration has proposed new rules to sharply limit tailpipe emissions, with the aim of compelling automakers to devote at least two-thirds of new sales to EVs within the next decade. For this policy to work, the government will have to get a lot of other things right. The logic behind the plan is straightforward: To eliminate carbon emissions by 2050, the US needs to slash pollution from cars and trucks. Getting more electric vehicles on the road will help. But without supporting policies, EVs are unlikely to cut carbon emissions as much as advocates envision. Policymakers owe the public an honest accounting of costs and benefits. Worldwide, EVs account for 13% of new car sales, up from 0.2% a decade ago. Their market share in the US has nearly doubled over the last year, to 5.8%, thanks in part to federal tax credits of $7,500 included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden’s new regulations aim to accelerate the transition, by lowering the cap on carbon emissions for new vehicles by 56% between 2026 and 2032. For automakers to meet the tougher standards, 67% of their sales would have to come from zero-emission EVs. The administration projects that this will reduce the US’s carbon footprint by 7.3 billion tons by 2055, the equivalent of eliminating four years’ worth of transportation-related emissions. Such goals are laudable, but as things stand it’s doubtful that the US can achieve them. Generous subsidies have juiced demand for EVs, but maintaining them will be costly. The average price of a new EV is still $12,000 higher than that of a gas guzzler. Experts project that it may reach parity as early as this year, but even then, Americans are unlikely to abandon their gas-powered cars if the battery-charging infrastructure remains inadequate. Note too that EV buyers don’t typically stop driving their other cars: Current EV owners have an average of 2.7 vehicles, compared to 2.1 among all households, and two-thirds use their gas-powered vehicles more often. Other factors will also complicate the transition. The auto industry’s rapid shift to EVs at the expense of new and more efficient gas-powered models might cause some consumers to keep driving dirtier vehicles longer than they otherwise would. Electric vehicles also create carbon footprints of their own, once one accounts for the mineral extraction needed to assemble their batteries and the electricity needed to power them. That’s to say nothing of the supply-chain challenges: At the moment, production of numerous vital components is largely controlled by China. EV uptake should certainly be encouraged — but alongside measures to mitigate these challenges and guard against unintended consequences. Policymakers need to speed the buildout of charging stations and promote domestic extraction of critical minerals. No less important, cheaper fuel-efficient alternatives and rival zero-emission technologies should be allowed to compete with EVs on level terms. Ideally, an economy-wide tax on carbon emissions should be part of the mix. This would raise the price of gasoline and encourage consumers to buy clean-energy cars (regardless of the technology used) while driving their older, dirtier models less. Crucially, it would also promote energy efficiency more broadly and accelerate efforts to decarbonize the supply of electricity. Granted, building political support in the US for a carbon tax is challenging. Until that changes, the government can still incentivize low-carbon transportation more effectively — by extending tax credits to gas-powered hybrids and imposing congestion charges on high-polluting cars in urban areas, for example. Fighting climate change requires a comprehensive and coherent strategy. EVs are part of the answer, but only part. Much hard work remains to be done.

Even electric self-driving cars may have a climate change problem,"The future energy required to run just the computers on a global fleet of autonomous vehicles could generate as much greenhouse gas emissions as all the data centers in the world today. That finding, announced by researchers from MIT on Friday, is based on a statistical model that calculated the energy outputs a fleet of 1 billion autonomous electric vehicles would generate if they ran one hour per day. The resulting number roughly translated to 0.3 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. For self-driving cars to drive autonomously, they require large amounts of computing power to run sophisticated algorithms and onboard camera systems to navigate traffic safely. The weirdest thing about being in a self-driving car While the findings are only projections, Soumya Sudhakar, a lead MIT researcher on the study, said the results should make self-driving car researchers and makers realize that “business-as-usual” is not enough, and computing efficiency should be at the forefront of their minds. “This has the potential to become an enormous problem,” she said in a statement. “But if we get ahead of it, we could design more efficient autonomous vehicles that have a smaller carbon footprint from the start.” Major auto manufacturers, from Tesla to GM, have made big bets on self-driving cars fueling the future. But they have been plagued withsafety concerns, technological challenges and delays. Still, the industry was roughly valued at $22 billion in 2022 and could grow to nearly $76 billion by 2027,market statistics show. Teslas running Autopilot involved in 273 crashes reported since last year To study the impact of this level of growth, researchers built a model to calculate how much emissions computers onboard a fleet of fully electric, autonomous vehicles would generate, study scientists said. The model estimated roughly 1 billion vehicles in a global fleet, along with power each car’s computer would use of roughly 840 watts, the average hours they are individually driven, and the carbon intensity of the electricity powering each computer. While that equation seems “deceptively simple,” Sudhakar said, it is difficult to calculate, because it’s still uncertain how self-driving vehicles would change driving habits. For instance, some research says self-driving cars would lead to longer drive times, because people can multitask. Others say drive time would decrease, because computers would find the quickest ways to  destinations. Researchers also found that to keep computer-generated emissions from spiraling out of control in the coming decades, each autonomous vehicle would need to consume less than 1.2 kilowatts of energy for computing, which would require hardware to double in efficiency roughly every 1.1 years, a “significantly faster pace” than what’s being done currently. In some scenarios, scientists also found that self-driving companies would need to make their computer hardware double in efficiency roughly every year for a global fleet to not blow past these emissions estimates by 2050. To boost efficiency, researchers said, scientists could develop specialized hardware designed to run specific driving algorithms, and power navigation and perception tasks. But that comes with a challenge, Sudhakar said, since vehicles often have 10- to 20-year life spans, so any current hardware upgrades might not be “future-proof” to run new algorithms. Companies are racing to make self-driving cars. But why? Researchers could also try to make algorithms more efficient and require less computing power, but they might have to trade off accuracy for efficiency and potentially impact vehicle safety, study authors said. Vivienne Sze, a study author and associate professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, said she hopes self-driving carmakers will take into account the emissions output and carbon efficiency of their technology. “The energy consumption of an autonomous vehicle is really critical,” Sze said. “Not just for extending the battery life, but also for sustainability.”","January 13, 2023 at 1:43 p.m. EST",washington-post,east-coast

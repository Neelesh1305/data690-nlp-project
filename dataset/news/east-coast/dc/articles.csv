Are electric cars really better for the environment?,"Electric vehicles, you might have heard, have a mineral problem. Beneath the floor of an EV sits a900-pound batteryfilled with minerals extracted from around the world. Millions of tons of lithium, cobalt, bauxite and other minerals are mined, processed, shipped and refined — sometimes leaving atrail of human rights and environmental abuses. For some, that makes fossil fuel engines look good by comparison. No one wants to drive around on thecobalt equivalent of blood diamonds. But does all this mining negate the climate and environmental benefits of EVs compared to sticking with gas? I looked into the world’s evolving supply chains for the clean-energy economy. In every scenario, it turns out, the demand for battery minerals represents a tiny fraction of the amounts of fossil fuels now needed to power the world. But not everything is measured in tons. For EVs to fulfill their clean-energy promise, they need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the first Industrial Revolution. Miners and manufacturers can embrace cleaner ways to get the materials they need, and recover more of what they use. Here’s how EVs and gasoline cars stack up. Almost all cars require steel, aluminum, copper, plastic, rubber and glass. Where EVs differ most from conventional vehicles is in their battery packs. Atypical 200-mile range EVlugs around a lithium-ion battery pack that’s nearly a third of the weight of the vehicle. Much of that weight is the battery pack’s casing, structural materials and aliquid electrolytethat ferries electrons around to charge and discharge the battery. But roughly 353 pounds are crucial minerals or metals, including cobalt, nickel, manganese, graphite, aluminum and copper,estimates Transport and Environment, a nongovernmental organization campaigning for cleaner transport. Not counting steel and aluminum, says MIT, anEV requires six times more minerals than a conventional vehicle. We will need a massive increase in these materials in the coming years. Global EV sales are predicted to surpass gas-vehicle sales in just over a decade after havingblown past early projections.General Motors, Volkswagen, Volvo, Hyundai and Hondacommitted to electrifying their lineup. With jurisdictions from California to theEuropean Unionprohibiting the sale of most new fossil fuel vehiclesby 2035, thevast majority of new passenger vehiclesare likely to be electric well before mid-century. That will mean expanding today’s mines and launching new ones. “The volume is large and it’s going to get very large,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science at the University of California at Berkeley. Gigafactories springing up around the world to build batteries are already straining the volume of clean-energy minerals the mining industry can produce. Mining minerals is never a clean affair. Cobalt from Congo, lithium and graphite from China, nickel from Indonesia and Russia, and battery supply chains thatrun through Xinjiang, in the Uyghur regionwhere forced labor has been rampant: All of these have immediate problems, which The Washington Post explored in our “Clean Cars, Hidden Toll” series. Guinea, home to the world’s largest bauxite reserves for aluminum,yields misery for local communities. Nickel refiners in Indonesia areadopting a risky technology. Mineworkers in South Africa, the world’s largest producer of manganese,face neurological ills. These environmental and social problems are real. But compared to the track record of the oil, gas and coal industry, they are a drop in the barrel. To compare EVs with conventional vehicles, first we need to look at how much stuff we pull out of the ground tomake and fuel them. Mining minerals for the clean-energy economy is measured in millions of tons per year. For fossil fuel extraction, that’s a rounding error. In 2020, building the world’s wind turbines, solar panels, EVs and other clean-energy infrastructure demanded 7 million tons of minerals,estimates the International Energy Agency. Roughly half of this was destined for batteries and EVs. The oil, gas and coal industry, by contrast, extracted the equivalent of15 billion metric tonsin 2019. And the industry will need to extract it year after year to keep supplying energy. Clean-energy technology can use these materials for decades or, if recycled, in perpetuity. “That’s a point we’ve been trying to make for a long time,” says Kwasi Ampofo, the head of metals and mining at BloombergNEF,aclean-energy research groupin London. “Even on a volumetric basis, it’s important to highlight the fact that fossil fuels are not comparable.” That remains true even if EVs and batteries were part of a massive, global transition to clean energy. In a scenario limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, the IEA estimates the amount of critical minerals needed would be roughly 500 times less in terms of volume than today’s fossil fuel extraction. Of course, material mined isn’t a perfect gauge of environmental damage. Local environmental effects tend to scale with the amount of stuff we pull out of theground. Extracting 1 ton of copper, for example, requires digging uparound 100 tons of ore. But even accounting for this, estimates Sam Calisch, a scientist at the nonprofit Rewiring America,mining minerals for the clean-energy economy amounts to extracting about five times less matter than what’s extracted by the fossil fuel industry. “This is still massive,” Calisch says. EVs already emitless than a thirdof the emissions per mile than their gasoline counterparts, on average, if you’re plugging into America’s electricity mix. But what if you account for emissions from mining metals, manufacturing, refueling and disposal of EVs? Noah Horesh, a researcher at Colorado State University who studies life cycle emissions in the transportation sector, has analyzed vehicles’ emissions over their life spans. Horesh estimates fossil fuel vehicles generate roughly twice the emissions of an EV, even accounting for emissions from extracting added minerals and metals. This difference will only grow as the electricity sectordecarbonizes, and battery manufacturingbecomes far more efficient. People recharging with clean electricity, or driving smaller vehicles, may already see a bigger difference today. Air pollution, one of theworld’s leading killers, will decrease as well. Fossil fuels are responsible for 4 million to8 millionexcess deathseach year tied to air pollution, reportstudies in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academies of ScienceandEnvironmental Research. Cleaning up the mineral supply chain for batteries, unlike the oil industry, remains a distinct possibility. The Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes automakers to use mineral supply chains in the United States or countries with close trade relations. Mining companies are being pushed, or forced, to clean up their act as buyers, automakers and countries demand more transparent supply chains. New technology is also reducing negative impacts. None of this is guaranteed.Lead the Charge, an advocacy network tracking the supply chains of the world’s leading automakers, says many are making progress on their efforts to eliminate emissions, environmental harms and human rights violations. “But as an industry,” it says, “there is a long way to go.” You cansee their leader board of automakers here. Still, we’re starting to see some changes. Researchers and battery makers are racing to replace nickel and cobalt with metals such as manganese and iron that are safer, abundant, nontoxic and cheap. “There are only a few metals at the intersection of what we can use and what we produce a lot of,” says Ceder. “But we’re seeing significant progress in that area.” Manufacturers now usesix times less cobaltin EV batteries, or have eliminated it entirely in recent years. Last year, half of the vehicles Tesla sold in the first quartercontained batteries with no cobalt or nickel. Recycling already holds great promise. Today,only about 5 percent of lithium-ion batteriesacross all products are recycled in the U.S. Within a few decades, accordingto the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation, the vast majority of EV batteries will likely be collected and repurposed for a second life such as grid energy storage, or recycled, cutting the EV demand for minerals by about a third. Lead-acid car batteries provide a model: an estimated 99 percent are recycled. That has created a nearly closed loop for reusing lead, report researchers inthe peer-reviewed journal American Economic Review: Insights. “The transition to low-carbon fuels is not a magic bullet with no negative outcome,"" says Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist at MIT. “There is no free lunch. But it’s much less harmful than if we stay with fossil fuels. That’s the conclusion.”","September 19, 2023 at 6:30 a.m. EDT",washington-post,east-coast
Electric Vehicles Alone Can’t Solve Climate Change,"Arresting climate change requires, among other things, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. But managing the transition from gas-powered cars won’t be easy. President Joe Biden’s administration has proposed new rules to sharply limit tailpipe emissions, with the aim of compelling automakers to devote at least two-thirds of new sales to EVs within the next decade. For this policy to work, the government will have to get a lot of other things right. The logic behind the plan is straightforward: To eliminate carbon emissions by 2050, the US needs to slash pollution from cars and trucks. Getting more electric vehicles on the road will help. But without supporting policies, EVs are unlikely to cut carbon emissions as much as advocates envision. Policymakers owe the public an honest accounting of costs and benefits. Worldwide, EVs account for 13% of new car sales, up from 0.2% a decade ago. Their market share in the US has nearly doubled over the last year, to 5.8%, thanks in part to federal tax credits of $7,500 included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden’s new regulations aim to accelerate the transition, by lowering the cap on carbon emissions for new vehicles by 56% between 2026 and 2032. For automakers to meet the tougher standards, 67% of their sales would have to come from zero-emission EVs. The administration projects that this will reduce the US’s carbon footprint by 7.3 billion tons by 2055, the equivalent of eliminating four years’ worth of transportation-related emissions. Such goals are laudable, but as things stand it’s doubtful that the US can achieve them. Generous subsidies have juiced demand for EVs, but maintaining them will be costly. The average price of a new EV is still $12,000 higher than that of a gas guzzler. Experts project that it may reach parity as early as this year, but even then, Americans are unlikely to abandon their gas-powered cars if the battery-charging infrastructure remains inadequate. Note too that EV buyers don’t typically stop driving their other cars: Current EV owners have an average of 2.7 vehicles, compared to 2.1 among all households, and two-thirds use their gas-powered vehicles more often. Other factors will also complicate the transition. The auto industry’s rapid shift to EVs at the expense of new and more efficient gas-powered models might cause some consumers to keep driving dirtier vehicles longer than they otherwise would. Electric vehicles also create carbon footprints of their own, once one accounts for the mineral extraction needed to assemble their batteries and the electricity needed to power them. That’s to say nothing of the supply-chain challenges: At the moment, production of numerous vital components is largely controlled by China. EV uptake should certainly be encouraged — but alongside measures to mitigate these challenges and guard against unintended consequences. Policymakers need to speed the buildout of charging stations and promote domestic extraction of critical minerals. No less important, cheaper fuel-efficient alternatives and rival zero-emission technologies should be allowed to compete with EVs on level terms. Ideally, an economy-wide tax on carbon emissions should be part of the mix. This would raise the price of gasoline and encourage consumers to buy clean-energy cars (regardless of the technology used) while driving their older, dirtier models less. Crucially, it would also promote energy efficiency more broadly and accelerate efforts to decarbonize the supply of electricity. Granted, building political support in the US for a carbon tax is challenging. Until that changes, the government can still incentivize low-carbon transportation more effectively — by extending tax credits to gas-powered hybrids and imposing congestion charges on high-polluting cars in urban areas, for example. Fighting climate change requires a comprehensive and coherent strategy. EVs are part of the answer, but only part. Much hard work remains to be done.

Buy an electric vehicle now or wait? Here’s how to decide.,"Thecoronaviruspandemic saw a virtually unprecedented spike in the price of vehicles. As chip shortages hobbled the industry, automakers rationed semiconductors, installing them mainly in their most profitable, and most expensive, models. Millions of affordable vehicles, the ones accessible to most new car buyers,never got built. That drove up the median price of new vehicles in the United States from around $38,000 before the pandemic to a record$49,000 or so this February, according to Cox Automotive. With electric vehicles, the pain was even more acute — if you could find one. In February, the average EV price soared to more than $58,000,accordingto Kelley Blue Book, roughly theannual income of the median U.S. worker.Dealers have been able to charge well over the sticker price as buyers have lost the ability to negotiate. “If someone hasn’t been in the market, they’ll be really shocked by how much a vehicle costs,” says Mark Wakefield, an automotive specialist at the global consulting firm AlixPartners. The limited supply of EVs is colliding with unexpected demand. Despite inventories at a fraction of their pre-pandemic levels, EV sales are outperforming even the more optimistic projections of a few years ago. In January 2022, EVs represented just4.3 percent of new sales. This January, the share was more than 7 percent. “EVs are still hot enough they’re essentially sold out for the rest of the year,” says Ivan Drury, who analyzes the automotive market for Edmunds. But even with vehicle prices near record highs, better deals may soon be at hand. Tesla isslashing prices, prompting the rest of the EV industry to follow suit. New federal tax subsidies are coming online, though which vehicles qualify is a moving target. And automakers are releasing a fleet of new all-electric models over the coming months. What’s a prospective EV buyer to do: Buy now or wait? There’s no right answer, but the decision boils down to a few other questions: How much can you spend? What type of vehicle do you need? Do you (or your EV) qualify for federal incentives? Would you buy used or lease? Here are the key questions for an EV shopper. Yes, slowly. EVs remain well above the industry average,reportsKelley Blue Book, but prices have been on a steady decline since the beginning of the year. The new federal incentives could lower them even more. Tesla started reducing prices to guard its dominant market as some federal incentives for Tesla’s EVs are phased out undernew rules on April 18. Since January, Tesla has cut the prices of its base Model 3 and Model Y by11 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Tesla still controlsmore than halfof the EV market in the United States, and other automakers have followed its lead. The average price paid for a new EV in February fell by 1.8 percent, or $1,050, over the previous month,reports Kelley Blue Book. Another factor is more models hitting showrooms.Dozens of new all-electric modelsare expected to debut in the next two years, expanding the EV selection beyond today’s concentration in sedans and small crossovers and SUVs. Rivals could start lowering prices more as competition heats up. When it comes to electric vehicles, your options are large, affordable or long range. “You can pick two,” says David Undercoffler of Autolist, an online car shopping platform. Small sedans and hatchbacks like the Model 3, Model Y, Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf have been the mainstays of the market. The Bolt starts at$26,500. Recently, automakers have focused on selling somewhat compact SUVs and crossovers with ranges of about 250 miles. That includes the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Tesla Model Y, Kia Niro EV and Volkswagen ID.4. “If that’s the size vehicle they’re looking for, go for it,” says Undercoffler. “But for a middle-class family looking for a large, affordable, family, electric SUV, there’s really nothing there yet.” Selection is scarce across the board, especially for larger vehicles popular in the United States.  If you want a truck, Rivian might be able to deliver its$80,000 flagship modelin a matter of months. If you want the Ford F-150 Lightning, delivery could take as long asthree years. Expect automakers like Kia and Hyundai, both with breakout electric successes, to expand options at the lower end of the market. Toyota, after resisting all-electric models, finally released thebZ4Xlast year. And there is a distant prospect of inexpensive, made-in-China EVs arriving in the United States. China’s electric automakers are eager to enter the U.S. market just as Toyota, Hyundai and other Asian automakers did decades ago selling small, low-cost vehicles. In 2021, Toyotabumped GMas the top-selling automaker in the United States. For now, the only Chinese automaker to sell lots of cars in the United States is the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group after buying the Swedish automaker Volvo in 2010. Chinese companies face stiff economic head winds given punishing U.S. tariffs. Past attempts by Chinese automakers to avoid tariffs bybuilding vehicles in South Koreahaveled to bankruptcy. As relations with China deteriorate, don’t hold your breath for inexpensive Chinese EV imports. New purpose-built electric vehicles are now arriving. Early electric models were gasoline models with engines ripped out and replaced with electric motors tocomply with California’s strict clean-air regulations. These “compliance cars” were produced in small numbers with little exciting technology or marketing to attract buyers. “Today’s vehicles are so different,” says Drury at Edmunds. “It’s not the same vehicle anymore.” New electric vehicles not only offersuperior performance,but promise lower prices than conventional vehicles once global manufacturers ramp up production backed by more thanhalf a trillion dollarsin new investment. But no one I spoke to thought that huge technology shifts would make your new EV obsolete anytime soon, predicting steady, incremental gains, mostly in battery range and model diversity. “Buying an EV is kind of like buying a desktop computer in the past,” says Undercoffler. “Every 12 months, a newer, faster, cheaper version comes out. But if you wait, then you’ll never buy a computer.” The one thing to look out for issolid-state batteries. But even those will take quite a long time. Today’s EVs generally rely on lithium-ion batteries. These use aliquid electrolyteto conduct electricity. Solid-state batteries replace this liquid with a solid, often ceramic material. Their primary advantage is that it allows manufacturers to packabout two times more energyinto the same space. Imagine a 500-pound, solid-state battery with the same range as today’s 1,000-pound lithium-ion packs. It can fully recharge in about10 minutes, with less risk of fire. It’s also quick and cheaper to manufacture. The catch? Solid-state batteries remain expensive, resource intensive and hard to recycle. Once those obstacles are overcome, they could be a game changer. But commercial production may be three to five years away, and mass-market adoptiona decade or more. The next decade will be the American “golden age” for electrified vehicles, says Sara Baldwin of Energy Innovation, an energy and environmental policy firm. That’s thanks largely to the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers buyers of eligible EVs a full ($7,500) or partial ($3,750) tax credit for vehicles made in the United States and supported by domestic supply chains or countries with free-trade agreements. But the criteria are byzantine. To qualify for the subsidies, all vehicles must be assembled in North America. Any vehicle with batteries or critical minerals from a still unspecified “foreign entity of concern” does not qualify. Rising percentages of batteries, battery components and critical minerals must also be sourced from North America or free-trade-agreement nations. Personal income and vehicle price limits apply. Confused? Don’t worry. So is one of the bill’s key authors, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). The senator, who insisted EV subsidies be focused on American suppliers, recently admitted he was unaware that a free-trade agreement did not exist between the European Union and the United States — jeopardizing the bloc’s ability to compete in the United States. A trade deal is being worked out now. To help you out, I’ve added adecision tree below, produced by Energy Innovation, to tell if you and your vehicle qualify for federal incentives. Another way to figure this out? Wait until April 18. The Internal Revenue Service will issuean updated list of what vehicles qualifyunder the incentive program. The list is likely to shrink before it grows, as automakers must shift their supply chains toward North America and free-trade-agreement nations to meet increasingly stringent criteria. You can alsodetermine tax credit eligibility by looking up the vehicle identification number on this Energy Departmentwebsite. “Once the list is out here, it will be pretty straightforward,” says Baldwin. “That’s the good news.” And the federal government is considering even more stringent rules to pressure automakers to sell more EVs. One of the Environmental Protection Agency’sproposed auto emissions plans, the toughest one to date, would aim to have as many as two-thirds of all new passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2032. There’s one way to sidestep many of these restrictions: Lease an electric vehicle. Baldwin says all leased EVs qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit because auto dealers are eligible to take the tax credit as commercial entities. “For those eager to start driving an EV immediately and start saving on fuel costs, a leased EV may offer a great interim solution,” she says. A second option is buying used. It’s a much cheaper way into the EV market, and there are no restrictions on the make or model for a tax credit of 30 percent up to $4,000, assuming vehicle price and buyer income requirements are met.Check out this flow chartto see if you qualify. “This tax credit could prove to be a game changer for the market given that most people buy used vehicles today,” says Baldwin. And used-car prices are finally coming back down. On the high end, the automotive research companyiSeeCars.comfound electric models like the Audi e-tron, Volkswagen ID.4, and Ford Mustang Mach-E werediscounted by 20 percent or morebelow new-car prices on average, a savings of up to $23,000. “There are deals out there if you do some research,” says Karl Brauer ofiSeeCars.com. For a more affordable option, early versions of the Nissan Leaf, Ford Focus electric hatchback and Fiat 500eselling for $5,000 to $9,000can be found. Their battery range may be degraded to 50 miles or less, but if you want a city car or a second vehicle, older models might be the ticket. From a strictly financial standpoint, it’s better to wait if you can.New cars are a financial loss the moment you drive them off the lot,collectible Tesla Roadsters aside. “Buying a new car is never a good investment,” says Wakefield at AlixPartners. “These are depreciating assets.” Putting off the purchase until you really need it allows you to get the most out of your existing vehicle. But there are exceptions: Do you have a long commute? Are you still driving a 30-year-old gas guzzler? Did your old vehicle conk out? Then EVs can have a significantly lower lifetime cost and emissions. Electricity is generally cheaper and cleaner. Maintenance like brake pads and oil changes are not required. And EVs are expected tolast much longer, with some manufacturers talking aboutmillion-mile batteries. So if you need a car right now, you’re in a better place than even a few months ago. If you can wait, your bank account will thank you. But for many people, cars are not just rubber, metal and batteries. Asresearchersandmarketersrealize, a car purchase isnot an economically rational decision. It’s about what we value. For those who want to have less impact on the climate, and need a car, an EV might be worth every penny. A previous version of this article incorrectly said the Chevy Bolt's base price was $40,875. The Bolt starts at $26,500. The article has been corrected.","April 11, 2023 at 6:30 a.m. EDT",washington-post,east-coast
Electric vehicles are hitting a road block: Car dealers,"As news started coming out aboutelectric carsin early 2016, Michael Young, a self-described “car guy,” knew he wanted to try one. One afternoon, he strolled into his local dealership and asked to test drive the BMW i3, a small, sporty car with a range of up to 150 miles. The salesperson stopped him. “You can’t drive that car on the highway,” Young recalls the salesperson saying, explaining that the car couldn’t go over 45 miles per hour. “I was kind of dumbfounded by that,” Young said. Young knew it could go much faster — and, after convincing the salesperson to let him go on a test drive,ultimately bought the i3. The experience motivated him to launch awebsitethat helps consumers shopfor electric vehicles. But the incident underscores a problem that still plagues electric vehicles: Many U.S. buyers say car dealerships, which sell the majority of new vehicles, are not prepared for the electric transition. The Biden administration aims to have as many as two-thirds of new cars sold in the United Statesbe electric by 2032; andautomakers have investedhundreds of billions of dollarsin EVs. But if car dealers don’t want to sell EVs, the country’s electric transition could be in jeopardy. Car sales are unlike any other commercial transactionin America. For most products — everything including shoes and iPhones — you can buy directly from the manufacturer or in dozens of other stores. Cars used to be the same: Before World War II, people bought personal vehicles at big-box department stores, from the manufacturers themselves and even at gas stations. But in the 1940s and 1950s, dealerships — which were mostly single-family businesses — argued that the powerful automakers could undercut their sales and drive them out of business. Over the next two decades, dozens of states passed laws to protect dealers; many of them prevented manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. In recent years, Tesla, which does not use car dealerships, has fought some ofthose laws in court. The company has won in some states and, in others, has received workarounds that allow a few select storefronts. Still, many automakers have to sell their vehicles through one of the country’s more than 16,000 franchisedauto dealerships. And those salespeople often don’t have extensive training on how to sell an EV or even on the technology itself. Frustrated customers told TheWashington Post that dealers tried to redirect their attention toward gas cars, or gave incorrect or unclear answers to questions about charging and day-to-day electric vehicle use. James Richards, the CEO of a water heating company in Davis, Calif., spent days test-driving EVs at Volkswagen, Tesla, Chevy and Ford. But the 40-year-old found the dealership experience “cringeworthy” — the dealers didn’t seem to know much about the EVs they were selling. “I felt like I knew more than they did,” Richards said. Initially, Richards was hoping to buy an F-150 Lightning, but the truck was back-ordered. The salesperson could only get him an expensive trim that came with a high dealer markup. That markup added “insult to injury,” Richards said. He ended up buying a Tesla Model Y. Tesla salespeople “strike you as EV geeks,” Richards explained. “All the other dealerships: Ford, VW, the GM people — they didn’t seem like specialists.” Maya Batres, a 34-year-old adviser for an environmental organization, bought a used Fiat 500e from a dealer in February 2022. The dealer, she said, didn’t know much about EVs but was happy to make the sale since she and her husband came prepared. But when it came time to sign the paperwork, the salesperson offered her a plan for oil changes and an extended warranty for a gas-powered car. “I knew we didn’t need that,” Batres said, laughing. Which electric vehicle is right for you? Check out our guide. EVs are complex. There are three types of charging ports and three different speeds of charging for electric vehicles. (Young recalls a salesman telling him that he could use Tesla’s charging network for a non-Tesla vehicle, long before the company beganopening their fast chargersto other cars.) Electric cars also often come with new features like one-pedal driving and adaptive cruise control. Then there is the maze offederal and state tax incentivesthat can help drivers afford a new or used EV — but only if the dealer and the consumer can understand how they work. Some dealers, however, don’t seem to want to offer electric cars: According to asurveythat the Sierra Club conducted at the end of 2022, 66 percent of dealerships did not have an EV available for sale. That was at the height of EV supply chain problems, but 45 percent of those dealers — or 30 percent of all dealers surveyed — said they wouldn’t offer an EV even if they could. Amid concern over an EV slowdown, electric cars are sitting longer on dealerships’ lots than gas-powered cars. According to data from Cox Automotive, dealerships started the year with a roughly 50 days’ supply of gas cars and electric cars. Now the supply of gas cars is around the same, but the supply of EVs has doubled. Dealers may have less economic incentive to sell electric vehicles. Buzz Smith, a former Chevrolet car salesman who now helps train dealers to sell EVs, says it can take muchlonger to sell an electric car than a gas-powered one. A gas car, he said, might take no more than an hour in a single visit to sell, yielding a tidy commission. But for electric vehicles, “it was usually four visits, an hour each, before they would buy the EV,” Smith said. Customers want to make sure they understand the technology, how to charge it and more. “So I’m volunteering to take a 75 percent pay cut — and no salesman wants to do that.” Smith said he believes the pay structure of auto salespeople isn’t a good fit for the EV era. Electric cars have narrower profit margins, he said, which cuts into the commission a dealer can get. And if a customer returns to the dealership multiple times, salespeople may have to split the commission, again cutting into their take-home pay. At the same time, car dealerships make most of their overall profits from providing service for vehicles — not selling new cars.According to ananalysisfrom the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 16 percent of dealers’ gross profits came from new car sales, while 43 percent came from parts, labor and service. (The rest of the profits come from used car sales and financing and incentives.) “It’s a lot like giving away the razor to sell the blade,” said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who studies the laws and economics of car dealerships. That could also discourage dealers from selling EVs. Gas cars have 100 times more moving parts than electric vehicles do, and studies show that EVs have lower maintenance costs. An average gas-powered car, for example, needs an oil change about every six months, or every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. But many electric cars don’t require a major service until around150,000 miles. “They’re all terrified of that loss of maintenance,” Smith said. But EVs are still new enough, Smith said, that customers will return to dealers because they don’t want their neighborhood mechanic to try to service their car. Some dealers are working to embrace the new technology. Claire McDonald, the president of a Ford dealership in Waco, Tex., said her salespeople were excited to do the training thatthe automaker offered on how to sell EVs. “It’s a part of our future,” she said. They’ve only sold a dozen or so electric cars so far, she said, but she sees it as a key part of the business model going forward. “I’m not here to push EVs, for or against,” she added. “I’m here to help our customers understand their needs.” Mike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, says dealerships have invested around $6 billion in preparing to sell and service electric vehicles. “Dealers have stepped up and done what is needed,” he said. But Stanton said the EV transition — especially with the Biden administration’s aggressive goals on electric car sales — is moving too quickly. “This is going way too far,” Stanton said. “We’ve got to consider the mainstream market, or bad things are going to happen.” Others — like Crane, who has submitted legal briefs supporting direct-to-consumer sales — say that the dealership-only model simply isn’t suited for the electric future — and may add to a car’s price tag. “Dealers don’t want to change the model,” he said. “They want to be the gatekeepers.”","Updated November 9, 2023 at 12:10 p.m. EST|Published November 9, 2023 at 6:30 a.m. EST",washington-post,east-coast

So far, the grid has essentially shrugged it off. “We haven’t seen any issue of the grid collapsing,”says Anne Nysæther, a managing director at Elvia, a utility serving Oslo and the surrounding areas with the nation’s largest concentration of EVs. The country, now almostentirely powered by renewables, has easily met the extra demand from EVs whileslashing greenhouse gas emissions. That’s good, because Norway will ban all new petrol anddiesel carsby 2025. The United Statesisn’t nearly as far along. Only8.4 percent of new car saleswere plug-in electric in the first quarter of 2023. But sales are growing fast:The White House wantshalf of all new automobile salesto be electric by 2030. To electrify everything — all these expected EVs, heat pumps and other big power draws — we’ll need to start building up our grid,according to Jesse Jenkins, an energy modeling and engineering expert at Princeton University. The United States must at least double its electricity supply by 2050, while stringing up 75,000 miles of new high-voltage lines by 2035, the equivalent of 15 round trips from Los Angeles to New York City, and connect new wind and solar generation to the grid. That sounds like a lot. But something like this has already been done. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the U.S. built new transmission capacity at a speed close to what is required today,writes Jenkins inMother Jones,even as electricity demand grew. In fact, battery electric vehicles can bepart of this solution. EVs are energy storage on wheels. Rather than charging at peak hours, EVs can soak up cheap, renewable electrons from solar during midday or from wind late at night. With a smart system to coordinate them, EVs should not overstress the grid. The challenge is intelligently managing how the load is distributed,not building a bunch of new power plants just for EVs. What does a solar system add to the value of a house for resale? — Pennyvia live chat Historically, solar adds value. A 2013Berkeley National Laboratory studyanalyzing 1,894 home sales in California showed buyers consistently paid higher premiums for homes with solar photovoltaic panels, which were compared to upgrades such as renovating a kitchen or bathroom. To get an idea of how much your panels boost your home’s value, take a look at how much they save you each year on your electricity bill.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory also cites datashowing “solar increases home value by $20 for every $1 reduction in annual utility bills.” A solar energy system that reduces your annual utility bill by $200, for example, theoretically adds about $4,000 to the resale value of the home. Yet the exact percentage is hard to pin down, since it’s related to factors such as geography, utility rates, the age of your solar panels, and the local real estate market. The real estate firm Zillowlooked at sales datafrom 2018 to 2019. It concluded homes with solar-energy systems sold for 4.1 percent more than comparable homes without solar power, an additional $9,274 on average. But that finding hasn’t stayed consistent, says Amanda Pendleton, who directs home trends research for Zillow. In Zillow’s most recent analysis of sales of 1.98 million homes listed in 2022, homes with solar panels did not command a premium, probably because of the exceptionally tight and expensive housing market, she suspects. “Affordability is the biggest challenge for home buyers today,” she says. “People say they want it, but at the end of the day, the question is what can they afford.” Generally speaking, the more you save on energy, the more this should increase the value of your home. But your mileage may vary. I find there are good things happening embracing history and modernism and ecology in Japan, developing and linking community with city public transport, country hiking trails, historic roads and towns viewed from ecology-minded optimism. — Junco Pollack via email In 2005, Japan’s prime minister made an urgent call to his top environmental official: The country needed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol had just entered into force and Japan’s emissions were rising. To avoid an embarrassing failure to meet the climate treaty’s targets, environment minister Yuriko Koikesought a way to cut Japan’s emissionsin years not decades. Office buildings offered an enticing target. Commercial buildings have the potential for enormous emission reductions. In most industrialized countries, they’re responsible formore than 10 percent of countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than appeal to people’s sense of environmental duty, Koike transformed their workplace culture instead. The ministry launchedCool Biz, a new clothing brand in collaboration with the textile and fashion industries, featuring cooler, breathable materials. Famous Japanese CEOs modeled the styles on the runway. The new clothes meant offices could cut back on air conditioning.In public buildings, jackets were banned for government workers. Office thermostats were allowed to rise to 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer. Researchersestimatethe Cool Biz initiative slashed carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to the annual output of several natural gas power plants. I share this story not because it is the solution to climate change — Japan’s culture is unique — but because it illustrates the types of solutions we should be exploring. Oftentimes, the most effective fixescome from rethinking old ideas, shifting social norms, and learning from others with very different experiences. Even if they’re outside the United States.","June 13, 2023 at 6:30 a.m. EDT",washington-post,east-coast

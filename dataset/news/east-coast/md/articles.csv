Most electric vehicles won’t qualify for federal tax credit,"DETROIT — A tax credit of up to $7,500 could be used to defray the cost of an electric vehicle under the Inflation Reduction Act now moving toward final approval in Congress. But the auto industry is warning that the vast majority of EV purchases won’t qualify for a tax credit that large. That’s mainly because of the bill’s requirement that, to qualify for the credit, an electric vehicle must contain a battery built in North America with minerals mined or recycled on the continent. And those rules become more stringent over time — to the point where, in a few years, it’s possible that no EVs would qualify for the tax credit, says John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, a key industry trade group. As of now, the alliance estimates that about 50 of the 72 electric, hydrogen or plug-in hybrid models that are sold in the United States wouldn’t meet the requirements. “The $7,500 credit might exist on paper,” Bozzella said in a statement, “but no vehicles will qualify for this purchase over the next few years.” The idea behind the requirement is to incentivize domestic manufacturing, build a robust battery supply chain in North America and lessen the industry’s dependence on overseas supply chains that could be subject to disruptions. Production of lithium and other minerals that are used to produce EV batteries is now dominated by China. And the world’s leading producer of cobalt, another component of the EV batteries, is the Democratic Republic of Congo. Though electric vehicles are part of a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they require metallic elements known as rare earths, found in places like Myanmar, where an Associated Press investigation has found that the push for green energy has led to environmental destruction. Under the $740 billion economic package, which passed the Senate over the weekend and is nearing approval in the House, the tax credits would take effect next year. For an EV buyer to qualify for the full credit, 40% of the metals used in a vehicle’s battery must come from North America. By 2027, that required threshold would reach 80%. If the metals requirement isn’t met, the automaker and its buyers would be eligible for half the tax credit, $3,750. A separate rule would require that half the batteries’ value must be manufactured or assembled in the North America. If not, the rest of the tax credit would be lost. Those requirements also grow stricter each year, eventually reaching 100% in 2029. Still another rule would require that the EV itself be manufactured in North America, thereby excluding from the tax credit any vehicles made overseas. Automakers generally don’t release where their components come from or how much they cost. But it’s likely that some versions of Tesla’s Model Y SUV and Model 3 car, the Chevrolet Bolt car and SUV and the Ford Mustang Mach E would be eligible for at least part of the credit. All those vehicles are assembled in North America. The tax credit would be available only to couples with incomes of $300,000 or less or single people with income of $150,000 or less. And any trucks or SUVs with sticker prices above $80,000 or cars above $55,000 wouldn’t be eligible. There’s also a new $4,000 credit for buyers of used EVs, a provision that could help modest-income households go electric. The industry says the North American battery supply chain is too small right now to meet the battery component requirements. It has proposed that the measure expand the list of countries whose battery materials would be eligible for the tax credit to nations that maintain defense agreements with the United States, including NATO members. One component of the bill would require that after 2024, no vehicle would be eligible for the tax credit if its battery components came from China. Most vehicles now have some parts sourced in China, the alliance said. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat and a leading ally of Detroit automakers, complained that Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a critical Democratic vote, had opposed any tax credits for EV purchases. “I went round-and-round with Senator Manchin, who frankly didn’t support any credit of any kind, so this is a compromise,” Stabenow told reporters Monday. “We’ll work through it and make this as good as we can for our automakers.” Manchin, long a holdout Democrat who negotiated terms of the deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, had blocked previous climate and social spending proposals. Manchin’s office declined to comment. Stabenow asserted that the bill was written by people who don’t understand that manufacturers can’t simply flip a switch and create a North American supply chain, though they are working on it. Numerous automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota and Hyundai-Kia, have announced plans to build EV battery plants in the United States. Stabenow said she remains hopeful that the Biden administration can offer the tax credits next year while it works on the detailed rules for the battery requirements. “We will continue to work with the automakers and the administration on getting as much common sense into the regulations as possible,” the senator said. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the White House and the Treasury Department, which would administer the credits. Stabenow says she’s pleased that the measure would restore tax credits for General Motors, Tesla and Toyota, all of which hit caps under a previous bill and can no longer offer them. Ford, too, she said, is closing in on an EV cap. AP Writers Matthew Daly and Fatima Hussein contributed to this report from Washington.",2022-08-09 10:54:00,baltimoresun,east-coast
Dan Rodricks: All charged up for an electric car? Getting an affordable one is still a challenge. | COMMENTARY,"If you own an electric car or truck, or drive a hybrid plug-in, congratulations: You’ve made it to the 1%. At the end of July, there were 52,966 EVs or hybrid plug-ins registered in Maryland. That’s just 1% of all motor vehicles across the state. It has been 25 years since the first generation of the Toyota Prius — albeit a hybrid, not a hybrid plug-in with a larger battery — came off the assembly line. Since then, there’s been immense progress in battery technology, along with greater political and cultural acceptance of the environmental need to move away from gas-powered automobiles. So, given all that, you’d think Maryland, one of the wealthiest, highest educated, eco-conscious and bluest states in the country, would be further along in the purchase of emissions-free vehicles. “One percent doesn’t sound like much,” says R. Earl Lewis Jr., a deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation. “But it is, when you look at the growth rates. We had 52,966 [EVs] at the end of July. We had 600 in 2012.” That suggests significant public buy-in of a still developing technology. If not for the pandemic, the state might have reached its goal of 60,000 EVs by 2020. It’s becoming increasingly clear that more people are enticed into the cool idea of owning battery-powered cars with only 20 moving parts and no gas tank. Current sales are robust. Just between the end of May and the end of July, another 4,575 EVs were registered in Maryland. People have noticed important developments. Battery capacity is increasing along with battery production. The driving range of EVs has improved significantly. (Both the Chevy Bolt EV and the Hyundai Kona EV can get close to 260 miles on a single charge.) The price of gasoline, rigged on the global market, has people thinking about making the transition. And the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, passed by the Senate and House — with all Republicans opposed, of course — renews tax credits of up to $7,500 for EVs that are assembled in North America and powered by batteries made with “critical minerals’' that come from the U.S. or countries with which we have free trade agreements. So there’s somefine print involved in the incentives— because of their high price tags, some models won’t be eligible for them — and all of that makes the buyer’s calculations more challenging. Still, the incentives will last a decade and should give sales in the U.S. market a significant boost, particularly among middle-class consumers. That’s the hope anyway. Biggest issue: The price point for EVs is intimidating right now. The average electric car price in the U.S. hit $66,000 in July, according to Electrek, the EV news website. Demand has dealers marking up prices. When I recently inquired about the cost of one of the more affordable EVs, a Baltimore-area dealer added $5,000 on top of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price “due to the global microchip shortage as well as the supply chain crisis.” That pushed the sale price to just short of $40,000. On the other hand, another dealer offered a manufacturer’s rebate on a comparable, four-door EV, lowering the cost to about $37,000. Timing is everything — in love, comedy and buying an EV. The federal incentives are significant, but it might be wise for the Maryland General Assembly to again offer a tax credit for the purchase of a new or used EV, aimed at Marylanders of modest means who think EVs are priced out of their reach. While the sales and marketing gets sorted, the infrastructure to support the EV future expands. “I think there’s a bright future for EVs,” says Lewis. As a deputy secretary of transportation, he serves as chairman of — stand by for the long title — theMaryland Zero Emission Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Council. That’s the group planning for the EV future, building out the electrical infrastructure to increase citizen confidence in making the transition. Havingenough charging stationson or near highways is critical. A friend of mine, ecstatic about owning one of the first Chevy Bolts, sold the car after a couple of years because he could not find enough fast-charge stations between his home in Harford County and his hunting grounds in Maine. Another friend loves his Bolt but only recently felt confident that he could locate a charging station, if needed, between Baltimore and Deep Creek Lake, in the Western part of the state. The current Bolts, the EUV and EV, have, respectively, ranges of 247 and 258 miles on one charge, and while that sounds great for daily commutes, it’s longer trips that give some people pause about going electric. So expanding the number ofcharging stationsis a huge piece of the EV future. According to the Department of Transportation, there are now 1,241 stations with 3,373 charging outlets in Maryland. And there’s more to come, says Lewis, with some $60 million in federal funds slated over the next five years for Maryland’s EV corridors. The plan is for a charging station every 50 miles, and within one mile of a highway. So, if all that holds, if the price points come down, if the incentives work, then Lewis is correct about a bright future for EVs in Maryland. Just think: Baltimore to Ocean City on a little more than half a charge and no gas.",2022-08-16 11:12:00,baltimoresun,east-coast
Rivian electric car plant blasted by foes at Georgia meeting,"MONROE, Ga. — Opponents trying to derail a $5 billion, 7,500-job electric truck plant in Georgia dominated a state meeting this week that was meant to gather suggestions on how to design the plant to mitigate any impact on the environment. The state assumed oversight over the Rivian Automotive project after opponents overwhelmed Morgan County planning and zoning officials. The plant was announced by the company and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in December, and is the biggest single industrial project in state history. The first meeting of one of the oversight committees was Monday in the city of Monroe. The Irvine, California-based electric vehicle manufacturer announced last year that it would build the facility on a 2,000-acre (809-hectare) site in Morgan and Walton counties about 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Atlanta along Interstate 20. It plans to produce up to 400,000 vehicles a year there. Rivian, which also has a plant in Normal, Illinois, said it hopes to break ground as early as this summer and begin production in 2024. The state panel, led by John Eunice, deputy director for the state Environmental Protection Division, did not get much cooperation from a hostile crowd that gathered at Athens Technical College in Monroe, news outlets reported. Opposition to the plant has been heavy from Rutledge-area residents who say the plant will spoil their rural quality of life. Residents criticized the meeting as a sham, saying it’s impossible to make meaningful suggestions when there’s not yet a plant design and saying the state is only working to get the plant built. “I was sitting at home and I saw my governor get on TV and say Rivian, 2,000-acre plant, coming to Rutledge, Georgia and it’s a done deal,” said Pam Jones.

Brian Kemp stands next to a Rivian electric truck while announcing the company's plans to build a $5 billion plant east of Atlanta projected to employ 7,500 workers, Dec. 16, 2021, in Atlanta.(John Bazemore/AP) Many speakers Monday voiced concerns about possible well-water contamination, light pollution, and the disruption of wildlife habitats and farmland for heavy industry. “I don’t understand why you are sitting on that side of the table, which is the Rivian side of the table and why you’re not sitting over here asking Rivian and Gov. Kemp to explain this environmental project and how it’s a disaster,” said Edwin Snell of Oconee County. A Rivian executive was present via video conference but did not speak during the hearing. A spokesperson for Rivian said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for the company to gather input and that the company is committed to sharing details of their plans for the site once they are complete and “meet our own high design and environmental standards.” The plant is a subject of contention in Georgia’s Republican primary for governor, with former U.S. Sen. David Perdue attacking Kemp for agreeing to the Rivian location without support from neighbors. Eunice said he does not know when Rivian will file for environmental permits needed to build the facility. He said the division will take public comment on the permits. Monday’s meeting was the first of four planned for the site design and environmental committee. The state plans four meetings each with three other committees tasked with examining quality of life, workforce and local business engagement issues.",2022-04-20 12:13:00,baltimoresun,east-coast
"Hogan administration won’t match California’s electric cars rule this year, frustrating Maryland advocates","Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration won’t be putting forward a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 — mimicking a decision by California — before he leaves office. Environmental advocates had been hoping the Republican governor’s administration would advance a policy matching California’s before the end of the year. They argue that, by waiting,Maryland could fall behind California, where 35% of new light-duty cars sold must be zero-emission in model year 2026. Maryland must give manufacturers two model years of notice before the rule takes effect. A 2007 state law mandates that Maryland follow California’s vehicle emissions standards, which are stricter than the federal government’s. Several other states havesimilar arrangements. But the process is in the hands of Hogan’s Department of the Environment. The department decided to wait on a final approval of California’s rule by that state’s Office of Administrative Law, said MDE spokesman Jay Apperson. That approval came Nov. 30, after the policy was approved by the California Air Resources Board in August. To begin the process in Maryland, MDE must submit a policy to theAir Quality Control Advisory Board, which held its last meeting of the year Monday. Its next meeting is scheduled for March 13. Now, implementing the policy will fall to incoming Democratic Gov. Wes Moore’s administration. In a statement Wednesday, Brian Jones, a spokesman for the Moore transition team, said the administration will “work expeditiously to meet the goals adopted by the legislature” in accordance with the 2007 law. “The urgency and leadership that Gov. Elect Moore will bring to combating climate change were made clear during the campaign,” Jones added. Atthe air quality board’s meetingMonday, Lindsey Mendelson, transportation representative with the Maryland Sierra Club, said she was disappointed that the policy was not on the agenda for December. “This should be low-hanging fruit,” she said. “Manufacturers are already supporting this, [Office of Administrative Law] finalized it in California, other states are moving on it. So, if we don’t adopt it this year, it cannot be enforced in 2025, or model year 2026. We’ll be falling behind.” In response, Chris Hoagland, director of MDE’s Air and Radiation Administration, confirmed that the policy won’t be advanced in Maryland this year. “It’s the department’s intent to bring [the policy] to this council at a future meeting as soon as we can,” Hoagland said. Several Maryland legislatorsalso called on Hogan’s administrationto take action before year’s end. Montgomery County Democratic Dels. David Fraser-Hidalgo, Kumar Barve and Marc Korman sent aletterearlier this year pushing for a 2022 adoption of the policy. The Maryland Commission on Climate Change also recommended the standard be enacted this year to help meet the state’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In a statement, Apperson said that Hogan’s administration “continues to conduct an interagency review” of the electric cars rule. In addition, Apperson added, the federal Environmental Protection Agency still must review California’s action. Under Republican President Donald Trump, the EPA revoked California’s ability to enact stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government. But President Joe Biden’s EPAreversed that decision this year.",2022-12-14 15:59:00,baltimoresun,east-coast
"California electric vehicle rule takes another step forward in Maryland, after hold-up under Gov. Larry Hogan","Maryland took a big step Monday toward eventually requiring all new vehicles sold in the state to be electric, with the state Air Quality Control Advisory Council’s unanimous approval of a regulation implementing California’s vehicle emissions standards. Under existing state law, Maryland is required to match California’s vehicle emissions programs, but Republican Gov. Larry Hogandelayed the rollout, meaning Maryland’s rule will take effect at least one model year later than the Golden State’s. The proposal requires anincreasing percentage of new carssold in Maryland to be zero-emission vehicles, starting with 43% in model year 2027. By model year 2035, all new passenger vehicles sold in the state would need to be zero-emission. Plug-in hybrid cars with at least 50 miles of all-electric range are allowed to account for 20% of the requirements. During a news conference Monday at the Maryland Department of the Environment headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore touted his administration’s ability to bring the regulation forward less than two months after his inauguration. “The last administration pumped the brakes on this regulation, but today I am proud to say that we’re getting rolling again,” said Moore, a Democrat. After his remarks, Moore hopped behind the wheel of an orange Ford Mustang Mach-E and took a spin around the parking lot — with a state trooper keeping a watchful eye in the passenger seat. Gov. Wes Moore drove an EV car around the parking lot after a news conference at the Maryland Department of the Environment headquarters.(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun) “Doing good shouldn’t be that fun,” he told reporters from behind the wheel. The rule is expected to be finalized around September of this year, said Justin Mabrey of the Maryland Department of the Environment’s Mobile Sources Control Program. Before then, the public will be given an opportunity to comment and the rule will receive an advisory review from a legislative committee. In a news release Monday, Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates blasted Moore’s decision to move forward with the program, and promoted a Republican-sponsored bill to evaluate the policy’s impact on the state’s economy and electrical grid before implementation. “This is a policy that was created in California. It is based on California’s economy, California’s transportation needs, and California’s electrical grid,” said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel in a statement. Environmental groups, including the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and the Maryland Sierra Club, applauded the Moore administration’s decision to move forward with the regulation Monday. “I’ve been doing this work for a long time, and I dream of a day like today,” said Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, who served on Moore’s transition team and co-chairs the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. During model year 2026 — the gap year separating California and Maryland’s programs — car manufacturers likely will be able to earn early compliance credits if more than 7% of the vehicles they sell in Maryland are electric cars. That percentage is the requirement for model year 2025 under existing law, Mabrey said. Once the program takes effect, manufacturers also would be able to trade zero-emission vehicle credits to help meet the requirement in the program’s early years, Mabrey said. So far, 17 states have adopted all or part of California’s standards, known as Advanced Clean Cars II, Mabrey said. Maryland is not the only state running a year behind California. New Jersey, for example, did not put forward the regulation in time to give manufacturers two years of notice before the rule takes effect, and is likely to start with model year 2027, too. Maryland legislatorscurrently are debating a similar requirementfor new, heavy-duty vehicles sold in the state, including trucks and buses. That standard also comes from California, where it is known as the Advanced Clean Trucks rule. In December  2021, California also finalized its “Heavy Duty Omnibus” regulation, which aims to reduce NOx emissions from heavy-duty trucks. During Monday’s air quality council meeting, Chris Hoagland, MDE’s director of air and radiation, said the administration technically doesn’t need approval from legislators to move forward with both rules for heavy-duty vehicles, though clarity from Annapolis would be welcomed. “Whether the legislation passes or not, we hope to bring Advanced Clean Trucks and omnibus to you all for consideration,” Hoagland said. Restricted from being able to drive on public streets for security reasons, Wes Moore (D), governor of Maryland putzes back and forth in a new all-electric Mach-E Mustang on the parking lot during a media event at Maryland Department of the Environment's Montgomery Park location, reinforcing the Moore administration's commitment to keeping the state on track to achieve its climate goals.(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun) Despite a unanimous vote in favor of the regulation, some members of the air quality council — which includes industry groups, a physician, academics and advocacy groups — expressed concerns about insufficient charging infrastructure in the state to accommodate an influx of electric cars. “Right now, it’s like finding the Easter egg to find charging at most local shopping centers,” said Ross Salawitch, a University of Maryland professor serving on the air quality council. In a letter to the Maryland air quality council, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation expressed concern that the policy includes “staggering required sales increases for a new technology that relies heavily on customer acceptance and market readiness.” As of 2022, about 7.86% of the vehicles sold in Maryland were electric, according to the Alliance. To improve on that number, the Alliance recommended an increase in public charging stations, including at transportation hubs such as airports. It also recommended the adoption of building codes addressing the need for electric vehicle charging stations. The state has about 1,300 public charging stations, said Timothy Shepherd, chief of MDE’s engineering and technology assessment division — an 18-to-1 ratio of vehicles to chargers. The administration has a goal of reaching 15-to-1, he said. But many electric vehicle drivers do the bulk of their charging either at their homes or their workplaces, Shepherd said. “There’s been a lot of focus to kind of cover what people want first, as we start to build out the program,” Shepherd said. “Obviously [highway] corridors will play an important role and shopping centers. But right now, the interest from most EV drivers is workplace and residential.” After passing the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation Monday, the air quality council agreed to draft a letter encouraging other relevant state boards to advance electric car infrastructure projects, including by exploring changes to the state building code. During Monday’s news conference at MDE, officials said they recognize the need for Maryland to improve its charging infrastructure as more electric vehicles hit the road. “It won’t be enough to just move forward with this regulation and then to simply call that alone a victory,” Moore said. “That is why my administration is focused on ensuring that Maryland leads on tax credits and rebates for folks who buy electric. It’s why we’re focusing on Maryland leading on building out a network of electric car charging stations.” Moore referenced his administration’s bill, the Clean Transportation and Energy Act, which would provide businesses and local governments with rebates to cover the difference in cost between medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles and gas-powered ones, and expands a rebate program for charging equipment. The bill remains in committee. Brendan Jones, president of Blink Charging, spoke during the news conference about his company’s production of electric vehicle chargers at SemaConnect in Bowie. The business received a contract to produce chargers for the U.S. Postal Service, Jones said, and is planning to scale up production by adding a new site close to its Bowie location. “We’ve already made the financial commitment on that. It’s millions and millions of dollars,” he said. “We’ll have that facility up and running within the next six months here in Maryland.”",2023-03-13 17:52:00,baltimoresun,east-coast
